Subject: [Project Clearwater] correct OID for Cacti
Message-ID: <CADbuDzxVtxcCt+Z+85igBMJFTTnibk7=ffVOKjFYjKLAYbzS1g@mail.gmail.com>

My OIDs seem to be different from the ones in the Cacti templates, for
Bono, Sprout etc. Am I doing something wrong?



Does anyone have the correct templates? Maybe a screenshot of your Cacti
graphs, please?



Thank you

Matvey,
I see the same issue for Sprout OIDs in Cloudify Clearwater template file:
https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/opnfv-cloudify-clearwater/blob/master/types/clearwater.yaml#L137
and bono OIDs which are being used for visualization using Grafana. I can
share you the correct OIDs for that file if that helps (don't have access
to the correct Cloudify template at the moment but can share you
today/tomorrow).

Kind Regards,
Junaid

Thanks, yes it appears the Cacti templates haven?t been kept up to date.

Instructions for using the correct MIB is at:  https://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Clearwater_SNMP_Statistics.html

If you do create an up to date cacti template, please submit a Pull Request with it (you would need to sign our contributors agreement).

Thanks,

Mark Perryman.

Thanks,
so for example:
> *snmpwalk -v2c -c clearwater 192.168.37.17:25565
<http://192.168.37.17:25565> 1.2.826.0.1.1578918.9.3.1.1.3*
produces:
PROJECT-CLEARWATER-MIB::sproutLatencyAverage.scopePrevious5SecondPeriod."node"
= Gauge32: 148
PROJECT-CLEARWATER-MIB::sproutLatencyAverage.scopeCurrent5MinutePeriod."node"
= Gauge32: 161
PROJECT-CLEARWATER-MIB::sproutLatencyAverage.scopePrevious5MinutePeriod."node"
= Gauge32: 139
Am I right to infer, that the *.3* in the end, replaces the deprecated *.2*
(or .2.1) in the end ?
(And that the .2 was a single metric, while the new one comes in 3
aggregations?)

The above seems to be translated from:
*.1.2.826.0.1.1578918.9.3.1.1.3*.1.4.110.111.100.101 = Gauge32: 148
*.1.2.826.0.1.1578918.9.3.1.1.3*.2.4.110.111.100.101 = Gauge32: 161
*.1.2.826.0.1.1578918.9.3.1.1.3*.3.4.110.111.100.101 = Gauge32: 139

So the logic to change the OIDs of the metrics must have been, that they
are not 100% backwards compatible?

Yes.

It looks like the OIDs were changed here: https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-snmp-handlers/pull/168/files

Hope that helps,

Mark.

So maybe someone has an up-to-date monitoring setup and willing to share?

BTW, looks like "Chronos" metrics were removed from Sprout. Perhaps
completely renamed? Or irrelevant?

Didn't figure out yet, what is the best way to graph the additional Sprout
metrics, not present in the template. So maybe someone has a setup, or
screenshots...

What about SNMP for SIPp? The Cacti template uses zero-mq, and nothing
interesting in SNMP there. Should it work? Or zero-mq only?

Mark, maybe you know: some of the OIDs, which were changed in the above
commit, seem to need an additional ".4.110.111.100.101" suffix. Does it
have something to do with the commit? Or where could it come from? (For
example: .1.2.826.0.1.1578918.9.3.1.1.3.2*.4.110.111.100.101*. Those which
didn't change, don't need this suffix.)

Thanks
