Subject: [Project Clearwater] Error when creating a user - Ellis
Message-ID: <CAPht7n7bG7RpyD69RRnEf+Sw5hA_2dt+OESXPTZScutVLRYSWA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!

I am currently an intern at NTT and I have been trying to get a Clearwater
cluster working on Kubernetes using the Clearwater-Docker repo from GitHub.
With some workarounds from these two archived messages below, I have been
able to get all my pods running:

http://lists.projectclearwater.org/pipermail/clearwater_lists.projectclearwater.org/2018-May/003980.html
https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-docker/issues/81#issuecomment-345677402

However, I do currently have an issue similar to the one found below:

http://lists.projectclearwater.org/pipermail/clearwater_lists.projectclearwater.org/2013-July/000919.html

Ellis is indeed able to ping Homestead, but I still am not able to create a
user. (Having the "Failed to update server" issue) Phone numbers were also
created correctly.

What is different though is that the configuration in
/etc/clearwater/shared_config seems to have the correct DNS entries and
using the a curl to the hs_provisionning pod returns me a "OK" response. I
also am able to do an ICMP ping from the Ellis pod to all the other ones
without any problem.

I am open to any suggestions that you might have.

Regards,
Isaac
