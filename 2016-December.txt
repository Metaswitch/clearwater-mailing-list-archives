Hi,

Thanks for getting in touch. In answer to your questions:


1)      Project Clearwater doesn?t integrate directly with an MRF, but you can configure an AS that can control the MRF, and we?ve successfully integrated with MRFs via an AS in the past.

2)

a.       See above ? once you have an AS that can control the MRF, you would configure the AS as normal (http://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Configuring_an_Application_Server.html)

b.      No, the built-in MMTEL TAS is not necessary. It will be installed on the Sprout node, but you don?t need to configure any calls to use it.



3)      Not all of these are necessary ? which ones you use are up to you:

a.       Ellis ? this is just to make provisioning easier. You don?t need to use it since you can also provision subscribers directly on Homestead (http://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Provisioning_Subscribers.html)

b.      Homer ? this is only required if you are using the built-in MMTEL TAS. If not, then Homer is not required.

c.       Ralf ? this is used for billing, and is not required for calls to work.

I hope that helps,

Seb.

Subject: [Project Clearwater] Clearwater Integration with MRF

Hi All,
It is a plesure to discover an opensource free vIMS as Clearewater is. Very interesting VNF Cloud platform to get training and testing. I'm quite new on Clearwater vIMS on the Cloud. I manually installed it in my Openstack Lab  and I'd like to have the following information:

1) Can Clearwater with MRF (Media Resource Function) be integrated ?
2) if It can, how can it with a MRF with SIP and RTP interfaces be integrated? Is TAS (MMTEL sproutlet) necessary anyway ?
3) Moreover, can Clearwater with only Bono, Sprout+TAS, Homestead,DNS/ENUM work properly ? Are Ellis, Homer and Ralf  necessary anyway ?
Thank you very much!
Have a nice day,

Hi,
I tried to find a opensource IMS application server to test my IMS system.
But I found nothing!!!
Could you please supply some opensource Functional IMS application for me?
(486 Call forwarding or Voice Mail)
I don't want just a proxy function IMS AS.
I will really appreciate.

Hi,

Project Clearwater?s built-in MMTEL TAS can do various types of call forwarding, including Call Forwarding on Busy. See http://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/IR.92_Supplementary_Services.html for the list of services that the MMTEL TAS can provide.

As for voicemail ? we don?t provide an AS that can do voicemail. However, we?ve experimented with using Plivo (https://www.plivo.com/open-source/, http://docs.plivo.org/get-started/) and produced a prototype voicemail server. We don?t actively support it, but it may be a useful starting point for you. You can find the prototype at: https://github.com/Metaswitch/plivo-apps/

I hope that helps.

Seb.

Hi CW Team,


*         We are deploying Clearwater using Kubernetes pods, container and services environment.

*         We adapted the environment of Kubernetes from docker compose environment as provided under https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-docker.

*         We have written yaml templates for each of the 10 modules. Each module is getting deployed as one container per pod.

*         Services are exposed for each of the pod as needed according to the docker-file exposed ports.

*         We have observed few of the containers are not working. These containers are homestead, homer and bono.

*         After debugging in to logs we found that the homestead is not able to resolve Cassandra DNS and thus not able to contact cassandra. Hence homestead service keeps on restarting.  Below is the error messages (/var/log/homestead/homestead_current)which keeps on repeating

However sometimes it keeps on giving the Failed to initialize the Cassandra cache with error code 3. So the behavior of working (homestead and Cassandra connection) is very random.

Subject: [Project Clearwater] Sprint Sandslash Release Note
Message-ID: <SN1PR02MB1664FCA1D86E30CCEB03EC558F820@SN1PR02MB1664.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>

The release for Project Clearwater sprint "Sandslash" has been cut. The code for this release is tagged as release-112 in GitHub.
This release includes the following bug fixes:

*         Sprout will incorrectly fail AKA authentication if the RES/XRES contains an 0x00 byte (https://github.com/Metaswitch/sprout/issues/1599)

*         Homestead requires a DNS entry for localhost (https://github.com/Metaswitch/homestead/issues/386)

*         Ralf has poor overload behaviour.  (https://github.com/Metaswitch/ralf/issues/58)

*         Chronos defaults include localhost as a staying node erroneously (https://github.com/Metaswitch/chronos/issues/315)

*         Chronos resync never ends if active timer is out of date and there is also informational timer (https://github.com/Metaswitch/chronos/issues/314)

*         Chronos callback treats HTTP failure responses as OK (https://github.com/Metaswitch/chronos/issues/312)

*         Chronos does not provide adequate diags for invalid config file (https://github.com/Metaswitch/chronos/issues/266)

*         Ellis generates nginx configuration with duplicate server names. (https://github.com/Metaswitch/ellis/issues/170)

*         In some scenarios Monit doesn't start (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-monit/issues/44)

*         We have a mmonit script in place, despite not using mmonit (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-monit/issues/40)

*         Updating shared config on all in one node fails the first time (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-etcd-plugins/issues/16)
To upgrade to this release, follow the instructions at http://docs.projectclearwater.org/en/stable/Upgrading_a_Clearwater_deployment.html. If you are deploying an all-in-one node, the standard image (http://vm-images.cw-ngv.com/cw-aio.ova) has been updated for this release.

Subject: [Project Clearwater] Clearwater Integration with MRF
Message-ID: <CANX2aNFEQDOPf-f6LDFN7Cu=WsLP6e8B9anAMjXAMJkODCLsCw@mail.gmail.com>

*Hi Sebastian, *
*thank you very much for your clarification. At this point I'd have other
related questions by answering to your reply: *

1)  Project Clearwater doesn?t integrate directly with an MRF, but you can

configure an AS that can control the MRF, and we?ve successfully integrated
with MRFs via an AS in the past.

-




*-> So what is a suitable TAS to integrate a RFC and 3GPP MRF    for
Clearwater Rapidash release ? if it is Telestax Restcomm    Media
Server, are the following docs and softwares valid     for Clearwater
release yet?     https://github.com/RestComm/mediaserver
<https://github.com/RestComm/mediaserver>
http://telestax.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ClearWater-RestComm-Integration-2013.pdf
<http://telestax.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ClearWater-RestComm-Integration-2013.pdf>*

*- - > Definitively, can I consider the following requirements in order to
integrate a    MRF with Clearwater and AS? (coming from Clearwater
documentation): *
MRFC control (RFC 4240 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4240.txt>, RFC 5552
<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5552.txt>, RFC 6230
<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6230.txt>, RFC 6231
<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6231.txt>, RFC 6505
<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6505.txt>)

   - These RFCs define three different ways of controlling the function of
   an MRFC from an AS. RFC 4240 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4240.txt> is a
   simple ?play an announcement? service, RFC 5552
   <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5552.txt> uses VoiceXML and RFC 6230
   <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6230.txt>/RFC 6231
   <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6231.txt>/RFC 6505
   <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6505.txt> use SIP/SDP to establish a two-way
   control channel between the AS and MRFC.
   - IMS allows any of the three mechanisms to be used, or combinations
   depending on circumstances.
   - All three mechanisms are transparent to proxy components, so supported
   by Clearwater.


2)

b.      No, the built-in MMTEL TAS is not necessary. It will be installed on
the Sprout node, but you don?t need to configure any calls to use it.

-->
*so it is confirmed with Clearwater Rapidash Built-in MMTEL AS*

*    cannot be configured to integrate a MRF, isn't it ?*

Thank you very much for your availability!
Have a nice day,
/Marcello

Hi,

For the first issue (the cassandra hostname not being resolvable) - from what you've written it sounds like your homestead pod is unable to get a DNS record for "cassandra" from your DNS server (10.96.0.10). Have you tried testing the DNS resolution from the homestead pod manually (using something like nslookup)? That may help you troubleshoot why it's not working. As you've found, however, you can specify an IP directly if you want.

As for your second issue, it sounds like you may be hitting issue: https://github.com/Metaswitch/homestead/issues/387. This has been fixed in the latest release ("Sandslash", release 112), so you may want to try upgrading to that release and seeing if it resolves your issue.

Thanks,

Seb.

Hi,

in answer to your questions:

?So what is a suitable TAS??
We don?t recommend a TAS to integrate with an MRF, but (as you point out) the docs at http://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/SIP_Interface_Specifications.html#mrfc-control-rfc-4240-rfc-5552-rfc-6230-rfc-6231-rfc-6505 should hopefully give you what you need to establish whether a TAS will work. (As those docs say, all 3 methods of controlling the function of an MRFC from an AS are transparent to proxy components, and so all 3 are supported by Clearwater).

?Is it confirmed that the built-in MMTEL AS cannot integrate directly with an MRF??
Correct, the built-in MMTEL AS is Project Clearwater cannot integrate directly with an MRF.

Hope this helps,
Seb.

Hi Sebastian,
thank you very much for your clarification. At this point I'd have other related questions by answering to your reply:
1)  Project Clearwater doesn?t integrate directly with an MRF, but you can

configure an AS that can control the MRF, and we?ve successfully integrated

with MRFs via an AS in the past.

--> So what is a suitable TAS to integrate a RFC and 3GPP MRF
    for Clearwater Rapidash release ? if it is Telestax Restcomm
    Media Server, are the following docs and softwares valid
    for Clearwater release yet?
    https://github.com/RestComm/mediaserver
    http://telestax.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/ClearWater-RestComm-Integration-2013.pdf
- - > Definitively, can I consider the following requirements in order to integrate a    MRF with Clearwater and AS? (coming from Clearwater documentation):
MRFC control (RFC 4240<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4240.txt>, RFC 5552<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5552.txt>, RFC 6230<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6230.txt>, RFC 6231<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6231.txt>, RFC 6505<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6505.txt>)

  *   These RFCs define three different ways of controlling the function of an MRFC from an AS. RFC 4240<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4240.txt> is a simple ?play an announcement? service, RFC 5552<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5552.txt> uses VoiceXML and RFC 6230<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6230.txt>/RFC 6231<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6231.txt>/RFC 6505<http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6505.txt> use SIP/SDP to establish a two-way control channel between the AS and MRFC.
  *   IMS allows any of the three mechanisms to be used, or combinations depending on circumstances.
  *   All three mechanisms are transparent to proxy components, so supported by Clearwater.


2)



b.      No, the built-in MMTEL TAS is not necessary. It will be installed on

the Sprout node, but you don?t need to configure any calls to use it.

--> so it is confirmed with Clearwater Rapidash Built-in MMTEL AS

    cannot be configured to integrate a MRF, isn't it ?
Thank you very much for your availability!
Have a nice day,
/Marcello

Hi All,

                I have used aio clearwater in openstack using qcow2 image
and registerd two users to it using two xlite phone.



                Users are getting registered but while calling getting
error like 480 User Not available.



                Just started to use this project so might be done some

Hi Pratap,

The easiest way to diagnose what?s going wrong will be to turn on debug logging for sprout on your node and take a look at the logs you get.

The steps for turning on debug logging are (as detailed here: http://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Troubleshooting_and_Recovery.html#sprout):

-          write log_level=5 to /etc/clearwater/user_settings

-          restart Sprout

Once you?ve done that, reproduce the problem, then collect the sprout logs from /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt

If it?s not obvious to you what the problem is from looking at the logs, feel free to send them to us and we?ll take a look.

Thanks,
Seb.

Hi,

I have finished the clearwater installation in seperate 6 VMs,
and clearwater runs correctly.

But I want to re-compile my sprout srouce code, especially icscf part.

1.How can I re-compile sprout  ?

2.Does it have to clone all of source code to Sprout VM?
Or I can compile the src code of finished Sprout VM after twisting the
icscf config file of Sprout VM and re-compile again.

3.Where is the i-cscf src code file after I installed Sprout VMs?

Thanks

Hi,

If you want to compile sprout from source, you can find the instructions here: https://github.com/Metaswitch/sprout/blob/dev/docs/Development.md. This should give you what you need to get started.

But you talk about changing a config file too ? if it?s just configuration options that you want to change, you may not need to re-compile sprout from source at all. Have you checked the config options guide at http://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Modifying_Clearwater_settings.html#modifying-sprout-json-configuration and http://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Clearwater_Configuration_Options_Reference.html? It may be that what you?re trying to do is easier done by just changing some config files.

If you do decide to re-compile sprout, then yes, you will need to clone the Github repo, as the source is not included in the installed Sprout node.

Hope that helps,

Seb.

Hi Seb,
thanks for your response,

I'm interested in change config, and I find the following description :
/etc/clearwater/s-cscf.json - contains information to allow the Sprout
I-CSCF to select an appropriate S-CSCF to handle some requests.

The capabilities of s-cscf.json seem like billing funciton or others.
Can I route the request to the specific sprout according to method type by
chaging s-cscf.json ?
e.g.
Register method to sprout1

grades,

Morris

No, you can?t use that config file to route requests to a different S-CSCF based on the request method, as the S-CSCF is selected on a per-subscriber basis (using the info provided by the HSS).

What are you trying to achieve by doing this? It may be that there?s some other way to do what you?re trying to do.

Looking at the log, I see the error below. It seems it is trying to configure port 172; it's not clear to me why it is trying to use this low port number. Do you have any suggestions? Please you can find more details on the log provided in attachment.

Hi Silvestro,

What version of Clearwater are you using? I'm wondering if you've got different versions of the base Sprout component and the Sproutlets, and this is causing the error. What's the output of running '/usr/share/clearwater/bin/clearwater-version'?

Looking at the log, I see the error below. It seems it is trying to configure port 172; it's not clear to me why it is trying to use this low port number. Do you have any suggestions? Please you can find more details on the log provided in attachment.



thanks in advance,

Silvestro

Message-ID: <CY4PR02MB2872CFB6EB47CDC20D8042E190900@CY4PR02MB2872.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>

The release for Project Clearwater sprint "Tauros" has been cut.  The code for this release is tagged as release-113 in GitHub.

This release includes the following bug fixes:


*         REGISTER expires 0 gets 401 Unauthorized rather than deregistering (https://github.com/Metaswitch/sprout/issues/1640)

*         AKAv2 authentication is not thread-safe (https://github.com/Metaswitch/sprout/issues/1600)

*         Deregistration in GR deployment causes sprout to send 2 deregistration HTTP requests to homestead (https://github.com/Metaswitch/sprout/issues/1555)

*         scary red cassandra logs when upgrading (https://github.com/Metaswitch/homestead/issues/396)

*         Homestead returns inconsistent HTTP errors (500 and 503) for the same underlying error (THRIFT_EAGAIN) (https://github.com/Metaswitch/homestead/issues/389)

*         SAS logs for Cassandra database failures are too low-level (https://github.com/Metaswitch/homestead/issues/388)

*         Errors reported when upgrading the Clearwater packages (https://github.com/Metaswitch/homestead/issues/333)

*         Homestead provides no useful indication why it fails for a MAA with an unsupported authentication scheme (https://github.com/Metaswitch/homestead/issues/308)

*         Misleading SAS log when running non-FT deployment (https://github.com/Metaswitch/homestead/issues/293)

*         Homestead-prov/Homer are spamming ping handler errors to syslog (https://github.com/Metaswitch/crest/issues/313)

*         Log spam in Crest (https://github.com/Metaswitch/crest/issues/297)

*         Crest based processes will sometimes not recovery properly if Cassandra fails (https://github.com/Metaswitch/crest/issues/283)

*         SyntaxWarning Error when installing Homer/Homestead (https://github.com/Metaswitch/crest/issues/216)

*         Running run-in-signaling-namespace not as sudo gives a misspelt error message (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-infrastructure/issues/398)

*         config-manager crashes if /etc/clearwater/shared_config contains non-ASCII content (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-infrastructure/issues/344)

*         Error log in syslog when cluster manager is restarted (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-etcd/issues/372)

*         check_cluster_state shows the clusters in a different order when run several times (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-etcd/issues/365)

*         In a 4-node deployment, etcd failed to start on one node and couldn't be trivially fixed (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-etcd/issues/359)

*         Cluster manager logs repeated errors in normal operation (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-etcd/issues/324)

*         Warning text when installing pyzmq (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-etcd/issues/258)

*         Mark node failed hangs when run on one of several failed nodes (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-etcd/issues/250)

To upgrade to this release, follow the instructions at http://docs.projectclearwater.org/en/stable/Upgrading_a_Clearwater_deployment.html.  If you are deploying an all-in-one node, the standard image (http://vm-images.cw-ngv.com/cw-aio.ova) has been updated for this release.

Hi Ellie,


below the output of the clearwater-version command. Please consider that I'm deploying Clearwater by Cloudify. The deployment seems to be completed but checking the status I see the error on Sprout node.


Thank you for your support.


BR,

Silvestro

Hi Silvestro,

What version of Clearwater are you using? I'm wondering if you've got different versions of the base Sprout component and the Sproutlets, and this is causing the error. What's the output of running '/usr/share/clearwater/bin/clearwater-version'?

Hi,



I'm trying to deploy Clearwater on an Openstack environment. I'm encountering an issue on the sprout node.

	server
Message-ID: <CAFVTNVzuSxRd1P-FRTPF9LMR=3_PDdNyngmMeh8p_jZu10xLQA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a situation where Sprout claims that it's sending a REGISTER packet
to my app server, but the packet never actually hits the wire, eventually
leading to a timeout.  Everything up to that point appears to be working
correctly.  This is the relevant part of the log, and it all looks fine:

The destination address - 172.16.0.42:5101 - is correct.  From the host
where sprout is running I can ping this IP address and a telnet to that
host:port successfully connects to the app server, so there doesn't appear
to be anything prohibiting the connection.  Unfortunately, a packet capture
doesn't detect that this REGISTER packet is actually being sent on any
network interface.

Can anyone suggest what might be the problem or how I may be able to debug
this?

I'm using Far'Fetched in case it matters.

Message-ID: <HE1PR05MB1467EEF3DC2AB99F5D93BAE9FC920@HE1PR05MB1467.eurprd05.prod.outlook.com>

I have been using clearwater in my small network for some time now which has been working very well and am very happy about it. 
Currently i have decided to change my network components to SDN components. I currently have a 2 SDN switches and an SDN controller connected to them. 
My problem now is to be able to let clearwater communicate to the SDN controller for resource reservation for call setup. That is how to integrate clearwater-ims into my SDN. 
I need help or guide about how to do this. 
Thank you in advance.

Abraham

Hi, Abraham

Although I'm not the developer of Clearwater, I think Clearwater is not integrated with any SDN controller now.
If you want to make your Clearwater system to communicate to SDN controller.
You can use rest-ful api, if your SDN controller supports so.
But in this way, you have to alter the source code of Clearwater to do this.
Or you can implement your own application to use rest-ful api to control to the SDN controller based on the vIMS status.

Regards
Jace.

Subject: [Project Clearwater] Clearwater ISC Interface with IP-SM-GW
Message-ID: <1c7e13d3e91e1038a917db17db56c701@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,



In the case where a SIP MESSAGE is sent to the IP-SM-GW over the ISC
Interface and the destination subscriber is not available.

When the terminating subscriber is Registering again, the IP-SM-GW shall
generate a SIP MESSAGE toward Clearwater.

This is a mobile terminated message it is not generated by a subscriber.



How do we allow the IP-SM-GW to sends these messages to the Clearwater.

Today Clearwater replies with a Forbidden message.



Configuration guidelines or/and call trace for such a case would be helpful.



B.R.
