Subject: [Project Clearwater] Private identies domain name isuue with Ellis
Message-ID: <CAPP7EwSQoQB=FNkdq11c8Fke1k33Kg4mGU+0WzucnGKX_HxjZg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

 I finished the install of clearwater IMS using the manual install with
openstack but I have a problem ; when I use the Ellis web interface my
users private identities are generated with another domain name "cw-ngv.com"
which is weird because I configured "clearwater.test" as my domain name.
Do you know how to resolve this kind of problem?

Thank you,

To whom it may concern,

I have been looking for a working Opensource IMS Server that I can use for
my research, but every one I've found or tried has configuration
limitations.

Is it possible to configure a Clearwater All-in-one image so that a phone
with the IMPI 001010123456789 at ims.mnc01.mcc001.3gppnetwork.org can register
using AKA? Please note that I cannot change the registration type or the
IMPI.

If it is possible, can you clarify which steps I should follow in what
order to reconfigure it properly? Thank you.

Midimistro,

Bono doesn?t support AKA.  Also the AIO package doesn?t allow you to change the realm.  You will need to deploy the nodes individually and setup a bind DNS box to be able to handle that realm.

Jake,

So since Bono doesn't support AKA, does that mean I am out of luck
completely for using Clearwater? Alternatively, does Clearwater support
Early IMS [IP address matching]?

And if I am not out of luck, that means I must deploy Clearwater manually
using multiple computers to set it up accordingly, correct?

Regards,


Midimistro

Midimistro,

In our IMS testing, I had to purchase a license for the Perimeta software.  Perimeta acts as a P-CSCF (AKA-MD5 authentications), and also performs the transcoding that you will also need to be able to communicate with most gateways.  For your second question, you will need at a minimum Dime, Sprout, Homer, Ellis, Vellum, and DNS.  For what it is worth?.Clearwater works GREAT for a voLTE IMS.  Lastly, not sure about early IMS.

Thanks

Midmistro,

Yes, while Project Clearwater's P-CSCF (Bono) does not support AKA, Clearwater's I/S-CSCF does if fronted by an AKA-capable P-CSCF such as Perimeta (https://www.metaswitch.com/perimeta-session-border-controller-sbc) - this is how we deploy Clearwater for VoLTE.

Regarding, early IMS, I'm afraid Bono doesn't support that either.

Thanks,

Matt

Hi Andrew,

A call in my architecture follows this flow: 
user1 <=> AS1 <=> AS2  <=> AS(1or3) <=> user2.

Every AS knows the URI of the next in chain.

I know how to apply an IFC to requests made by a user (using Ellis or a shared IFC), but not how to apply it to an AS.


The result I?m actually getting is the flow interrupting after AS1, because [from Sprout log]

So this is telling us that Bono is forwarding the SUBSCRIBE to itself from its trusted port 5058 (used to communicate with the IMS core) to its untrusted port 5060 (which SIP devices send their requests to). We then see in the logs Bono receiving this SUBSCRIBE and then rejecting it.

Messages containing SIP methods (like INVITEs, SUBSCRIBEs, REGISTERs etc.) are routed based off of the Route-header. If we look at the route headers for one of the SUBSCRIBERs we see:
>  
> Route: sip:scscf.cw-aio;transport=udp;lr;orig;username=6505550751%40example.com;nonce=716970855dbe8690 <sip:scscf.cw-aio;transport=udp;lr;orig;username=6505550751%40example.com;nonce=716970855dbe8690>

>  
> The next thing to consider then is why does the Route-Header not contain the port number? The Route header which is to be applied to future requests for a subscriber is communicated to Bono by the S-CSCF in a Service-Route header after it successfully authenticates a subscriber. If we have a look at the 200 OK in response to the registration we see:
>  
> Service-Route: sip:scscf.cw-aio;transport=udp;lr;orig;username=6505550751%40example.com;nonce=716970855dbe8690 <sip:scscf.cw-aio;transport=udp;lr;orig;username=6505550751%40example.com;nonce=716970855dbe8690>
>  
> This means that it is the S-CSCF that is causing Bono to attach a Route header to the SUBSCRIBE which does not contain a port number. To figure out why the S-CSCF is doing this could you please send me a copy of /etc/clearwater/shared_config and /etc/clearwater/local_config from the SPN and a copy of the SPN log file during a REGISTRATION and SUBSCRIBE.

Hi,

As per given Clearwater doc information
url: *http://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Manual_Install.html
<http://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Manual_Install.html>,*

I have installed *six machine manual installation *process of clearwater

I am getting *problem in making Ellis node up*.
Also there is *no log generation* where I could find any error .

After going through some mailing list mail where I found it was due to
misconfiquration of local_config But I checked it's properly configured.

Please let me know if I am doing any mistake in configuring.

Thanks and Regards,

Subject: [Project Clearwater] Clearwater on ARM Ubuntu 16.04 VMs
Message-ID: <D9A5FDF7-2EE9-4F08-AD8B-4C1166B4D792@sprint.com>

I am trying to install Clearwater on Ubuntu 16.04 ARM VMs, and I am running into problems with the Homestead node. I installed clearwater-cassandra from : http://repo.cw-ngv.com/~aarch64/repo/binary/

It appears to be running:

[homestead]sprint at homestead:/etc$ sudo service cassandra status

   Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/cassandra; bad; vendor preset: enabled)

Oct 05 11:57:31 homestead systemd[1]: Starting LSB: distributed storage system for structured data...
Oct 05 11:57:31 homestead systemd[1]: Started LSB: distributed storage system for structured data.

But the monit.log file says the the Cassandra process isn?t running and can?t start. I?m not sure what the problem is.

[EDT Oct  5 11:57:03] error    : 'cassandra_process' process is not running

[EDT Oct  5 11:58:13] info     : 'homestead_process' restart: /bin/bash


I also, do not see a cassandra log file in /var/log or anywhere that I can find. Has anyone had success installing Clearwater on the ARM platform that could provide some guidance:

Thanks,

Carl

Hi Carl,

Interesting problem. We don?t have many people looking at running clearwater up on ARM, so it?ll be good to work out what?s going on here.
As a first step, could you provide the following pieces of information:

?         The steps you took when installing the Java and Cassandra packages, and which packages you are working with (as we have seen some issues in the past with these)

?         The Cassandra.yaml file, under /etc/cassandra/

?         The output of `sudo monit summary` on the node, so we can see what processes are running/attempting to run

?         The contents of the local_config and shared_config files on the Homestead node, under /etc/clearwater/

?         The list of packages and versions installed on the system (something like dpkg -l , or dpkg-query -W)

Potentially there could be a problem stopping the cluster-manager from starting up correctly, which would stop it generating the config necessary for Cassandra to start up properly (the Cassandra.yaml file is automatically re-written using information taken from the etcd cluster). The fact that there is no log under /var/log/cassandra/ suggests that the service is not starting up at all.
This might be caused by an unhealthy etcd cluster: If the output of `sudo monit summary` suggests that the etcd process is not healthy, we should start by looking into that, with logs present in /var/log/clearwater-etcd/; if the process does look healthy we can also use `clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health` and `clearwater-etcdctl member-list` to verify that the cluster is both healthy and contains the nodes that we expect.
If etcd is unstable, you can try running it manually by taking it out of Monit?s control, by running `sudo monit unmonitor ?g etcd`, and then running `sudo service clearwater-etcd start`

Cheers,
Adam

Subject: [Project Clearwater] Clearwater on ARM Ubuntu 16.04 VMs

I am trying to install Clearwater on Ubuntu 16.04 ARM VMs, and I am running into problems with the Homestead node. I installed clearwater-cassandra from : http://repo.cw-ngv.com/~aarch64/repo/binary/

It appears to be running:

[homestead]sprint at homestead:/etc$ sudo service cassandra status

Oct 05 11:57:31 homestead systemd[1]: Started LSB: distributed storage system for structured data.

But the monit.log file says the the Cassandra process isn?t running and can?t start. I?m not sure what the problem is.

[EDT Oct  5 11:57:03] error    : 'cassandra_process' process is not running

I also, do not see a cassandra log file in /var/log or anywhere that I can find. Has anyone had success installing Clearwater on the ARM platform that could provide some guidance:

Thanks,

Carl

Prashanth,

Project Clearwater supports proxying the Presence messages (SIP SUBSCRIBEs and SIP NOTIFYs) - see the details in our documentation at http://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/SIP_Interface_Specifications.html#presence-event-package-rfc-3856

However, you will need a separate SIP Application Server which provides support for presence. Clearwater doesn't provide this function out of the box.

I'd expect that configuring Project Clearwater to support such an application server would simply be a case of providing a set of IFCs to trigger the application server when a SUBSCRIBE is received for the "presence" event package.


Thanks,

Richard

Where I could find the homer and homestead_provisioning and homestead_cache
in cassandra database
as we get in all in one image install preocess.

Please let me know.

Thanks and Regards,

Hi,

As per given Clearwater doc information
url: *http://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Manual_Install.html
<http://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Manual_Install.html>,*

I have installed *six machine manual installation *process of clearwater
with* six different roles and 1 DNS server* .
I am getting *problem in making Ellis node up*.
Also there is *no log generation* where I could find any error .

After going through some mailing list mail where I found it was due to
misconfiquration of local_config But I checked it's properly configured.

Please let me know if I am doing any mistake in configuring.

Thanks and Regards,
Ajit

Looks like homer.ims.hom is not resolving. If you are using actual DNS I am not surprised as .hom is not an accepted TLD as far as I am aware. Maybe you can do this if you are using private DNS, or you are using your /etc/hosts file.

Thanks Adam -
I really appreciate the help! Here is the info that you requested. My first reply apparently got hung up because it was too big and not approved for posting so I am breaking my response into pieces. The dpkg -l was too long. I do suspect that Cassandra is not installed properly, but if so, not sure where to get the correct package.
These are the instructions I was provided for the Homestead configuration.
If on a Homestead node, install Java and Cassandra First, copy the three files you downloaded ealier (python-support_1.0.15_all.deb, jdk9-server-release-1605.tar.xz and cassandra_3.5_cavium.deb) to the current directory, then run:
sudo apt-get install default-jre openjdk-8-jre python-pip jemalloc &&
sudo dpkg -i python-support_1.0.15_all.deb &&
tar xJf jdk9-server-release-1605.tar.xz &&
sudo mkdir /usr/jdk &&
sudo mv jdk9-server-release-1605 /usr/jdk/ &&
sudo chown -R root.root /usr/jdk &&
sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/jdk/ &&
sudo cp -R /usr/jdk/jdk9-server-release-1605 /usr/lib/jvm/java9-openjdk-1605 &&
sudo dpkg -i cassandra_3.5_cavium.deb &&
sudo rm -f /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/cqlshlib/copyutil.so &&
sudo pip install cassandra-driver
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install homestead homestead-prov clearwater-prov-tools -y && sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install clearwater-management -y && sudo systemctl daemon-reload

For the Cassandra part, I downloaded and installed clearwater-cassandra from : http://repo.cw-ngv.com/~aarch64/repo/binary/
Also, the jemalloc install failed because it couldn?t find it. I searched quite a bit on the internet and found and installed: sudo apt install libjemalloc-dev
I don?t know if that is the correct package.
There is no /etc/cassandra directory, I also noticed that there is no /var/log/cassandra directory either. So even though it appears that Cassandra is running, things don?t appear to look correct.
Here is the monit summary:

Hi Carl,

Interesting problem. We don?t have many people looking at running clearwater up on ARM, so it?ll be good to work out what?s going on here.
As a first step, could you provide the following pieces of information:
?         The steps you took when installing the Java and Cassandra packages, and which packages you are working with (as we have seen some issues in the past with these)
?         The Cassandra.yaml file, under /etc/cassandra/
?         The output of `sudo monit summary` on the node, so we can see what processes are running/attempting to run
?         The contents of the local_config and shared_config files on the Homestead node, under /etc/clearwater/
?         The list of packages and versions installed on the system (something like dpkg -l , or dpkg-query -W)

Potentially there could be a problem stopping the cluster-manager from starting up correctly, which would stop it generating the config necessary for Cassandra to start up properly (the Cassandra.yaml file is automatically re-written using information taken from the etcd cluster). The fact that there is no log under /var/log/cassandra/ suggests that the service is not starting up at all.
This might be caused by an unhealthy etcd cluster: If the output of `sudo monit summary` suggests that the etcd process is not healthy, we should start by looking into that, with logs present in /var/log/clearwater-etcd/; if the process does look healthy we can also use `clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health` and `clearwater-etcdctl member-list` to verify that the cluster is both healthy and contains the nodes that we expect.
If etcd is unstable, you can try running it manually by taking it out of Monit?s control, by running `sudo monit unmonitor ?g etcd`, and then running `sudo service clearwater-etcd start`

Cheers,
Adam

Subject: [Project Clearwater] Clearwater on ARM Ubuntu 16.04 VMs

I am trying to install Clearwater on Ubuntu 16.04 ARM VMs, and I am running into problems with the Homestead node. I installed clearwater-cassandra from : http://repo.cw-ngv.com/~aarch64/repo/binary/<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http:%2F%2Frepo.cw-ngv.com%2F~aarch64%2Frepo%2Fbinary%2F&data=02%7C01%7Ccarl.j.persson%40sprint.com%7C351a481b9b884cf735e908d50cc96484%7C4f8bc0acbd784bf5b55f1b31301d9adf%7C0%7C0%7C636428981472554313&sdata=TrGJ8nporbVdIeKkh%2FakxXVdp7QVcV2KaiQQP%2FmMwaI%3D&reserved=0>

It appears to be running:

But the monit.log file says the the Cassandra process isn?t running and can?t start. I?m not sure what the problem is.

I also, do not see a cassandra log file in /var/log or anywhere that I can find. Has anyone had success installing Clearwater on the ARM platform that could provide some guidance:

Thanks,

Message-ID: <FB2BCA66-33A2-4CE8-9B10-3AEEC469EF0C@sprint.com>

I am looking for a bit of help trying to install Clearwater on ARM, and the install can?t find jemalloc. I don?t see it in the http://repo.cw-ngv.com/~aarch64<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http:%2F%2Frepo.cw-ngv.com%2F~aarch64&data=02%7C01%7CCarl.J.Persson%40sprint.com%7Ca1ed6623fe854c70d1b408d50a954076%7C4f8bc0acbd784bf5b55f1b31301d9adf%7C0%7C0%7C636426558506353262&sdata=kCPpS7Wrm7tmvvbu4JoSshN32ePRIkD8X%2FA4CcLAXxk%3D&reserved=0> repo either. I searched the internet for a bit, and wasn?t able to find a version for aarch64. Do I need to just download the jemalloc source code from GitHub and compile it? If so, are there any special instructions?

I couldn?t find a cassandra.deb file on the internet for aarch64 either, but did notice clearwater-cassandra was in the ARM repo so I installed that. Will that work?

This is the current state of my cluster if you can point me to other issues I can resolve:

Hi Carl,

Interesting problem. We don?t have many people looking at running clearwater up on ARM, so it?ll be good to work out what?s going on here.
As a first step, could you provide the following pieces of information:
?         The steps you took when installing the Java and Cassandra packages, and which packages you are working with (as we have seen some issues in the past with these)
?         The Cassandra.yaml file, under /etc/cassandra/
?         The output of `sudo monit summary` on the node, so we can see what processes are running/attempting to run
?         The contents of the local_config and shared_config files on the Homestead node, under /etc/clearwater/
?         The list of packages and versions installed on the system (something like dpkg -l , or dpkg-query -W)

Potentially there could be a problem stopping the cluster-manager from starting up correctly, which would stop it generating the config necessary for Cassandra to start up properly (the Cassandra.yaml file is automatically re-written using information taken from the etcd cluster). The fact that there is no log under /var/log/cassandra/ suggests that the service is not starting up at all.
This might be caused by an unhealthy etcd cluster: If the output of `sudo monit summary` suggests that the etcd process is not healthy, we should start by looking into that, with logs present in /var/log/clearwater-etcd/; if the process does look healthy we can also use `clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health` and `clearwater-etcdctl member-list` to verify that the cluster is both healthy and contains the nodes that we expect.
If etcd is unstable, you can try running it manually by taking it out of Monit?s control, by running `sudo monit unmonitor ?g etcd`, and then running `sudo service clearwater-etcd start`

Cheers,
Adam

Subject: [Project Clearwater] Clearwater on ARM Ubuntu 16.04 VMs

I am trying to install Clearwater on Ubuntu 16.04 ARM VMs, and I am running into problems with the Homestead node. I installed clearwater-cassandra from : http://repo.cw-ngv.com/~aarch64/repo/binary/<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http:%2F%2Frepo.cw-ngv.com%2F~aarch64%2Frepo%2Fbinary%2F&data=02%7C01%7Ccarl.j.persson%40sprint.com%7C351a481b9b884cf735e908d50cc96484%7C4f8bc0acbd784bf5b55f1b31301d9adf%7C0%7C0%7C636428981472554313&sdata=TrGJ8nporbVdIeKkh%2FakxXVdp7QVcV2KaiQQP%2FmMwaI%3D&reserved=0>

It appears to be running:

[homestead]sprint at homestead:/etc$ sudo service cassandra status

But the monit.log file says the the Cassandra process isn?t running and can?t start. I?m not sure what the problem is.

I also, do not see a cassandra log file in /var/log or anywhere that I can find. Has anyone had success installing Clearwater on the ARM platform that could provide some guidance:

Thanks,

Carl

Thanks Adam -
I really appreciate the help! Here is the info that you requested. My first reply apparently got hung up because it was too big and not approved for posting so I am breaking my response into pieces. The dpkg -l was too long. I do suspect that Cassandra is not installed properly, but if so, not sure where to get the correct package.
These are the instructions I was provided for the Homestead configuration.
If on a Homestead node, install Java and Cassandra First, copy the three files you downloaded ealier (python-support_1.0.15_all.deb, jdk9-server-release-1605.tar.xz and cassandra_3.5_cavium.deb) to the current directory, then run:
sudo apt-get install default-jre openjdk-8-jre python-pip jemalloc &&
sudo dpkg -i python-support_1.0.15_all.deb &&
tar xJf jdk9-server-release-1605.tar.xz &&
sudo mkdir /usr/jdk &&
sudo mv jdk9-server-release-1605 /usr/jdk/ &&
sudo chown -R root.root /usr/jdk &&
sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/jdk/ &&
sudo cp -R /usr/jdk/jdk9-server-release-1605 /usr/lib/jvm/java9-openjdk-1605 &&
sudo dpkg -i cassandra_3.5_cavium.deb &&
sudo rm -f /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/cqlshlib/copyutil.so &&
sudo pip install cassandra-driver
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install homestead homestead-prov clearwater-prov-tools -y && sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install clearwater-management -y && sudo systemctl daemon-reload

For the Cassandra part, I downloaded and installed clearwater-cassandra from : http://repo.cw-ngv.com/~aarch64/repo/binary/
Also, the jemalloc install failed because it couldn?t find it. I searched quite a bit on the internet and found and installed: sudo apt install libjemalloc-dev
I don?t know if that is the correct package.
There is no /etc/cassandra directory, I also noticed that there is no /var/log/cassandra directory either. So even though it appears that Cassandra is running, things don?t appear to look correct.
Here is the monit summary:

Hi Carl,

Interesting problem. We don?t have many people looking at running clearwater up on ARM, so it?ll be good to work out what?s going on here.
As a first step, could you provide the following pieces of information:
?         The steps you took when installing the Java and Cassandra packages, and which packages you are working with (as we have seen some issues in the past with these)
?         The Cassandra.yaml file, under /etc/cassandra/
?         The output of `sudo monit summary` on the node, so we can see what processes are running/attempting to run
?         The contents of the local_config and shared_config files on the Homestead node, under /etc/clearwater/
?         The list of packages and versions installed on the system (something like dpkg -l , or dpkg-query -W)

Potentially there could be a problem stopping the cluster-manager from starting up correctly, which would stop it generating the config necessary for Cassandra to start up properly (the Cassandra.yaml file is automatically re-written using information taken from the etcd cluster). The fact that there is no log under /var/log/cassandra/ suggests that the service is not starting up at all.
This might be caused by an unhealthy etcd cluster: If the output of `sudo monit summary` suggests that the etcd process is not healthy, we should start by looking into that, with logs present in /var/log/clearwater-etcd/; if the process does look healthy we can also use `clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health` and `clearwater-etcdctl member-list` to verify that the cluster is both healthy and contains the nodes that we expect.
If etcd is unstable, you can try running it manually by taking it out of Monit?s control, by running `sudo monit unmonitor ?g etcd`, and then running `sudo service clearwater-etcd start`

Cheers,
Adam

Subject: [Project Clearwater] Clearwater on ARM Ubuntu 16.04 VMs

I am trying to install Clearwater on Ubuntu 16.04 ARM VMs, and I am running into problems with the Homestead node. I installed clearwater-cassandra from : http://repo.cw-ngv.com/~aarch64/repo/binary/<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http:%2F%2Frepo.cw-ngv.com%2F~aarch64%2Frepo%2Fbinary%2F&data=02%7C01%7Ccarl.j.persson%40sprint.com%7C351a481b9b884cf735e908d50cc96484%7C4f8bc0acbd784bf5b55f1b31301d9adf%7C0%7C0%7C636428981472554313&sdata=TrGJ8nporbVdIeKkh%2FakxXVdp7QVcV2KaiQQP%2FmMwaI%3D&reserved=0>

It appears to be running:

[homestead]sprint at homestead:/etc$ sudo service cassandra status

   Loaded: loaded (/etc/init.d/cassandra; bad; vendor preset: enabled)

But the monit.log file says the the Cassandra process isn?t running and can?t start. I?m not sure what the problem is.

[EDT Oct  5 11:57:03] error    : 'cassandra_process' process is not running

I also, do not see a cassandra log file in /var/log or anywhere that I can find. Has anyone had success installing Clearwater on the ARM platform that could provide some guidance:

Thanks,

Carl

Hi Nhi,

I?ve taken a look at the repository, and can?t see anything on our side that might be causing this issue. I also briefly tested setting up a completely blank machine in EC2, and was able to install the packages successfully following the manual install instructions at http://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Manual_Install.html

It could be that there is something corrupt in your local apt cache. Searching online for clearing out the apt list cache may help. E.g. possibly folling https://askubuntu.com/questions/621032/why-cant-apt-find-packages-file-when-compressed-versions-exist, and removing the contents of /var/lib/apt/lists/  and re-running apt-get update might resolve the problem.

Let us know how you?re doing with this. If you?re still hitting issues, can you let us know a bit more about the platform you?re installing on, and what the apt configuration etc. is.
Also, do consider signing up for the mailing list so that your messages don?t need to be approved by a moderator before they are sent out on the list.

Cheers,
Adam

Hi,
 I got the problem related to cassandra 2.1.15 when trying to install the dime node with lastest release as below:

The command that I used is ?sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install dime clearwater-prov-tools --yes?

 Is there something wrong with the package cassandra 2.1.15 on the site?
Could someone help to take a look and let me know the solution?

Thanks,
Nhi Dang.

Hi Ajit,

Taking a look at your first problem, with your Ellis Node, it looks like your etcd cluster is in a bad state. As etcd is what we use to form the rest of our clusters, I believe that the error ?Failed to update server? is occurring because your other nodes are also in a bad state; without a healthy etcd cluster we can?t set up the Cassandra cluster, among others, and that is what Ellis uses to store data when generating a private identity.
I see from your local_config that your etcd cluster is set up to be  ?etcd_cluster="172.16.1.23,172.16.4.195,172.16.5.22,172.16.4.37,172.16.1.142"?. These IPs seem to be spread across a larger subnet than we usually see deployed on (usually nodes are within a /24, but this is not inherently a problem), and I wonder if there is a connectivity issue between them; the etcd processes will all need to be able to contact each other to set up the initial cluster. Can you double check that all nodes are able to send traffic to each other on these IP addresses, and that the correct ports are open on any firewalls/security groups you have in place (etcd uses ports 2380 and 4000, the full details can be found at https://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Clearwater_IP_Port_Usage.html).

If this isn?t the issue, we need to work out what is causing the issues in your etcd cluster starting up. I would recommend taking a look in /var/log/clearwater-etcd/  across your nodes, at either the clearwater-etcd.log or clearwater-etcd-initd.log, and see if there?s anything useful in there. Running clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health on your other nodes will also allow you to work out if the whole cluster is broken, or if the initial cluster was successful, but some nodes have since failed.

Regarding your other query, I think you are unable to find the databases because of your first issue preventing the nodes from starting correctly. Once you have resolved your etcd problem, and all processes are able to start up correctly, assuming you are installing nodes as in the manual install instrucitons at https://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Manual_Install.html you will find the cassandra process running on your vellum node. You can access the databases using cqlsh, and you can then run `use <database name>` to access the data you are after. Tab auto-completion should give you the list of available databases/tables, and you will likely have ?homer?, ?homestead_cache? and ?homestead_provisioning?.

Hopefully this helps resolve your issues and get your deployment up.
Let us know how it goes,
Cheers,
Adam

I am getting *problem in making Ellis node up*.
Also there is *no log generation* where I could find any error .

After going through some mailing list mail where I found it was due to

Hi Carl,

Taking a look over the diagnostics, it looks like you don?t have cassandra installed. I think you?ve been slightly caught out by our package names; the clearwater-cassandra package is actually a wrapper around cassandra itself that provides a number of tweaks to the base cassandra installation for it to work with clearwater, but doesn?t provide the actual cassandra binaries.
To get your installation up and running, you will need to source a build of cassandra compatible with your ARM VMs; we don?t have anything available in the repo you?ve been using.

Once that is set up, the nodes should sort themselves out and have everything startup cleanly. If not, we may need to do a bit more work setting up the clusters to get them in a healthy state, and making sure that the clearwater-cassandra package is interacting with the different cassandra version as we expect it to.

Let us know if you manage to get it up and running
Cheers,
Adam

Thanks Adam -
I really appreciate the help! Here is the info that you requested. My first reply apparently got hung up because it was too big and not approved for posting so I am breaking my response into pieces. The dpkg -l was too long. I do suspect that Cassandra is not installed properly, but if so, not sure where to get the correct package.
These are the instructions I was provided for the Homestead configuration.
If on a Homestead node, install Java and Cassandra First, copy the three files you downloaded ealier (python-support_1.0.15_all.deb, jdk9-server-release-1605.tar.xz and cassandra_3.5_cavium.deb) to the current directory, then run:
sudo apt-get install default-jre openjdk-8-jre python-pip jemalloc &&
sudo dpkg -i python-support_1.0.15_all.deb &&
tar xJf jdk9-server-release-1605.tar.xz &&
sudo mkdir /usr/jdk &&
sudo mv jdk9-server-release-1605 /usr/jdk/ &&
sudo chown -R root.root /usr/jdk &&
sudo chmod -R 755 /usr/jdk/ &&
sudo cp -R /usr/jdk/jdk9-server-release-1605 /usr/lib/jvm/java9-openjdk-1605 &&
sudo dpkg -i cassandra_3.5_cavium.deb &&
sudo rm -f /usr/lib/pymodules/python2.7/cqlshlib/copyutil.so &&
sudo pip install cassandra-driver
sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install homestead homestead-prov clearwater-prov-tools -y && sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install clearwater-management -y && sudo systemctl daemon-reload

For the Cassandra part, I downloaded and installed clearwater-cassandra from : http://repo.cw-ngv.com/~aarch64/repo/binary/
Also, the jemalloc install failed because it couldn?t find it. I searched quite a bit on the internet and found and installed: sudo apt install libjemalloc-dev
I don?t know if that is the correct package.
There is no /etc/cassandra directory, I also noticed that there is no /var/log/cassandra directory either. So even though it appears that Cassandra is running, things don?t appear to look correct.
Here is the monit summary:

As a first step, could you provide the following pieces of information:
?         The steps you took when installing the Java and Cassandra packages, and which packages you are working with (as we have seen some issues in the past with these)
?         The Cassandra.yaml file, under /etc/cassandra/
?         The output of `sudo monit summary` on the node, so we can see what processes are running/attempting to run
?         The contents of the local_config and shared_config files on the Homestead node, under /etc/clearwater/
?         The list of packages and versions installed on the system (something like dpkg -l , or dpkg-query -W)

Potentially there could be a problem stopping the cluster-manager from starting up correctly, which would stop it generating the config necessary for Cassandra to start up properly (the Cassandra.yaml file is automatically re-written using information taken from the etcd cluster). The fact that there is no log under /var/log/cassandra/ suggests that the service is not starting up at all.
This might be caused by an unhealthy etcd cluster: If the output of `sudo monit summary` suggests that the etcd process is not healthy, we should start by looking into that, with logs present in /var/log/clearwater-etcd/; if the process does look healthy we can also use `clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health` and `clearwater-etcdctl member-list` to verify that the cluster is both healthy and contains the nodes that we expect.
If etcd is unstable, you can try running it manually by taking it out of Monit?s control, by running `sudo monit unmonitor ?g etcd`, and then running `sudo service clearwater-etcd start`

Cheers,
Adam

Subject: [Project Clearwater] Clearwater on ARM Ubuntu 16.04 VMs

I am trying to install Clearwater on Ubuntu 16.04 ARM VMs, and I am running into problems with the Homestead node. I installed clearwater-cassandra from : http://repo.cw-ngv.com/~aarch64/repo/binary/<https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http:%2F%2Frepo.cw-ngv.com%2F~aarch64%2Frepo%2Fbinary%2F&data=02%7C01%7Ccarl.j.persson%40sprint.com%7C351a481b9b884cf735e908d50cc96484%7C4f8bc0acbd784bf5b55f1b31301d9adf%7C0%7C0%7C636428981472554313&sdata=TrGJ8nporbVdIeKkh%2FakxXVdp7QVcV2KaiQQP%2FmMwaI%3D&reserved=0>

It appears to be running:

But the monit.log file says the the Cassandra process isn?t running and can?t start. I?m not sure what the problem is.

I also, do not see a cassandra log file in /var/log or anywhere that I can find. Has anyone had success installing Clearwater on the ARM platform that could provide some guidance:

Thanks,

Hi Rohit,

This mailing list is a great place for you to ask technical questions and get to grips with Project Clearwater. I?d recommend you sign up for the list so that your messages don?t get caught in our moderator filter though. Then just  send round your question with some technical details, and hopefully someone in the community can lend a hand.

If you?re after a more substantial level of support than that, Metaswitch can provide support for Clearwater through a paid contract. Let us know if that?s more what you?re asking about, and we can point you in the right direction.

Cheers,
Adam

Hi Devendra,

It looks like your etcd cluster is in a bad state. The fact that the error output states ?Joining an existing cluster, not joining an unhealthy cluster? suggests this node was once part of a healthy cluster, but since that point the cluster has lost quorum. Are you able to provide some more information about what led to the deployment being in this state?
It is possible that the etcd data became corrupt at some point due to a node failure, which is why the Ellis node is now attempting to rejoin the cluster. However, as the cluster as a whole entity is unhealthy it is unable to rejoin.

I would suggest that you:

?         Ensure all nodes in the deployment are able to contact each other at the IPs listed in the ?etcd_cluster? parameter, and that they have ports 2380 and 4000 open to traffic.

?         Check to see if other nodes are also in an unhealthy state

o   If multiple nodes have entered a bad state, you will need to re-create the etcd cluster from scratch. To do this, you can follow the process at https://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Handling_Multiple_Failed_Nodes.html

o   If only your Ellis node is unable to rejoin the cluster, it is likely an issue in traffic from the Ellis node being unable to reach the other members of the cluster

?         Check that the local_config on each node is correct, and that the IPs in the ?etcd_cluster? parameter are set correctly to the IPs of all nodes in your cluster

Hopefully this can get your deployment up and running. Let us know how you get on.
If you aren?t able to get it up and running with the above, try taking a look in the logs under /var/log/clearwater-etcd/ to see if you can find anything to help guide you.

Cheers,
Adam

Hi Emerson,

Can you provide some more information on the sort of data you?re after here?
With an idea of the sort of behaviours you are looking to train for, someone on here may be able to provide what you?re after, or we can point you at how to run your own Project Clearwater deployment to generate your own personalised data sets.

Cheers,
Adam

Message-ID: <CAO1UhdUeKH6dO+KbOZBkm+_9sAoO7kqrEW=qhve5rrYbTon3Ug@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Adam, thanks for the feedback.

I'm interested in training a neural network using TensorFlow to learn how
many bw or other interesting information is used in a normal transmission
of video, voice and text in a Clearwater environment in a real use, not in
my lab. So, I'm interested in a dataset that show me this information or
allow me to extract this information in any way.

Subject: [Project Clearwater] Enable AS to AS communication
Message-ID: <220F5E4D-EC63-49FD-BF0A-5347FE21177D@aleagames.com>

Hi all,

I have to setup Clearwater to support the following call flow:
user1 <=> AS1 <=> AS2  <=> AS(1 or 3) <=> user2

But I?m missing some configuration to enable AS1 <=> AS2 communication and I need a hint.

Both ASes are internally developed from scratch by my company.

Starting from a clean AIO image, relevant configurations applied are 

- dnsmasq.conf
srv-host=_sip._udp.scscf.cw-aio,scscf.cw-aio,5054
srv-host=_sip._udp.as1.service.example.com,example.com,5071
srv-host=_sip._udp.as2.service.example.com,example.com,5072

- /etc/hosts
10.2.0.91 example.com <http://example.com/>

- /etc/clearwater/shared_ifcs.xml

Using this configurations, AS1 is correctly addressed for both direct messages and third-party REGISTER, 
but messages to AS2 are being rejected with 500. From Sprout log:

Thanks for the help,

P.S.:
Same questions I?ve asked in thread http://lists.projectclearwater.org/pipermail/clearwater_lists.projectclearwater.org/2017-October/003639.html <http://lists.projectclearwater.org/pipermail/clearwater_lists.projectclearwater.org/2017-October/003639.html>,
but the question was originally another one, so I?m opening a new thread with an appropriate title.

Subject: [Project Clearwater]  Issue with restarting Bono
Message-ID: <22b2360e0ab4421ebc431b03d5b7d3e8@ex15p.necnz.internal>

Hi Clearwater,
I am running a manual install Release-89 bono/sprout/homestead/ibcf/dns configuration.
Recently I had need to restart the Bono node (virtual machine).
Following this, INVITE?s from both the external user side, and from the internal network side (from Sprout) were being rejected.
Service was not restored until some time later. I am not certain what restored the service.
Looking at the log file on Bono, it can be seen that the INVITE is rejected because of the lack of a flow token or route request.
Are you able to explain what the flow tokens are, and how they work, and more importantly,
what is the means to restore service after the Bono node has been restarted???
Or do I just have to wait until the flow tokens are recreated? What creates them?
Regards,
Peter

Hi Abraham,

>From the looks of things you have a number of issues with your installation. In particular, as you've highlighted, with Bono, but a number of other processes are being reported as failing in the `monit summary` checks. The check on bono is reporting that there is no /etc/init.d/bono present, which should be put in place by the installation; as a first step, I'd suggest ensuring that the package installations completed successfully.
Once you've done that, for each of the processes that is reporting failure, a good place to start is looking into the logs. The vast majority of our logs are written to files under /var/log/<process_name>/ (e.g. /var/log/bono/bono_20171019T150000Z.txt for bono at that time. Many logs also have <process>_current.txt file tracking the latest log file). Looking at these alongside the /var/log/monit.log file should allow you to get a good idea of what has gone wrong. If a process is not writing any logs, the monit.log should report the failures it is hitting, as it has with bono.

If you're unable to work anything out, pull out some additional diagnostics and logs, as well as giving us some information about the platform you're performing the installation on.
Cheers,
Adam

Hi Adam,

Sorry i did not mention that am trying to install using linux containers and maybe that is the reason of this errors.
Is it possible to install using linux containers, if yes can you provide me with any link or guide. 
Also is it possible to compile and run the nodes from source on linux containers. I know you have similar with docker.
However, my main aim is to integrate clearwater to an EPC and be able to make enhancement to clearwater to test 
call sessions from the EPC network.

Fig.
 	UE ?????????EPC??????????Clearwater(IMS)

Please any guide on how to get this done, am newbie in this field.

Thanks in advance.

Abraham

In particular, as you've highlighted, with Bono, but a number of other processes are being reported as failing in the `monit summary` checks. The check on bono is reporting that there is no /etc/init.d/bono present, which should be put in place by the installation; as a first step, I'd suggest ensuring that the package installations completed successfully.
> Once you've done that, for each of the processes that is reporting failure, a good place to start is looking into the logs. The vast majority of our logs are written to files under /var/log/<process_name>/ (e.g. /var/log/bono/bono_20171019T150000Z.txt for bono at that time. Many logs also have <process>_current.txt file tracking the latest log file). Looking at these alongside the /var/log/monit.log file should allow you to get a good idea of what has gone wrong. If a process is not writing any logs, the monit.log should report the failures it is hitting, as it has with bono.

Hi Emerson,

I don?t think we are going to be able to help provide anything here; Clearwater does not get involved with the media flows in a deployment, only the SIP signalling. If you are interested in more media control, Metaswitch does have a fully-fledged P-CSCF product, Perimeta, which can offer more in the way of data on media packets. I?d recommend getting in touch with our sales teams for more information.

Hopefully someone else on the list can help, and we?d be very interested to hear more of your findings on this.

Cheers,
Adam

Hi Adam, thanks for the feedback.

I'm interested in training a neural network using TensorFlow to learn how many bw or other interesting information is used in a normal transmission of video, voice and text in a Clearwater environment in a real use, not in my lab. So, I'm interested in a dataset that show me this information or allow me to extract this information in any way.

Subject: [Project Clearwater] Problem after Bono restart
Message-ID: <c3b1ef4e02294ebaa59f09b17859141f@ex15w.necnz.internal>

Hi Clearwater,
I am running a manual install Release-89 bono/sprout/homestead/ibcf/dns configuration.
Recently I had need to restart the Bono node (virtual machine).
Following this, INVITE?s from both the external user side, and from the internal network side (from Sprout) were being rejected.
Service was not restored until some time later. I am not certain what restored the service.
Looking at the log file on Bono, it can be seen that the INVITE is rejected because of the lack of a flow token or route request.
Are you able to explain what the flow tokens are, and how they work, and more importantly,
what is the means to restore service after the Bono node has been restarted???
Or do I just have to wait until the flow tokens are recreated? What creates them?
Regards,
Peter

Hi Abraham,



We haven't done any work for running Clearwater using the LinuxContainers infrastructure, though I see no reason it shouldn?t work. As you have seen though, we've got it running under Docker and Kubernetes, and there's the guides for doing so over at https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-docker . You may well be able to use the information there, and in the dockerfiles, as a basis for writing your own LXC setup. Or if LXC isn't a necessity for you, just running in containers, you may well be able to just take the details there and get your Clearwater deployment up and running.

If you want to compile from source, with our current container steps, you will need to build the code into debians first, and then install those onto the container images. If you look at our Dockerfiles, you could simply replace the step in cleawater-base that sets up the apt repository to point to your own local repository for installation.



If you are still following the manual install instructions, have you had a chance to go through and make sure they completed correctly? You haven't said whether you were able to resolve the issues you were seeing before.



As for your goal of integrating with an EPC, the Project Clearwater P-CSCF Bono doesn't support the Rx interface to the EPC. If that is something you will require, Metaswitch do offer a P-CSCF that does supports this interface. Let us know and we can point you in the right direction if that's something you'll need.

I am afraid we don't have any guides for setting up an EPC with Project Clearwater, though people on the mailing list here may be able to help as you work your way through it. If you're new to the area, I'd suggest reading up on the different interfaces and flows. There are lots of resources available on the internet, and it may help you work out what you need to work on.



Let us know how you are doing with the issues you were seeing previously. If you want to share your setup for running Clearwater using LXC we'd be really interested to see that work :)

Cheers,

Adam

Hi Adam,



Sorry i did not mention that am trying to install using linux containers and maybe that is the reason of this errors.

Is it possible to install using linux containers, if yes can you provide me with any link or guide.

Also is it possible to compile and run the nodes from source on linux containers. I know you have similar with docker.

However, my main aim is to integrate clearwater to an EPC and be able to make enhancement to clearwater to test call sessions from the EPC network.



Fig.

               UE ?????????EPC??????????Clearwater(IMS)



Please any guide on how to get this done, am newbie in this field.



Thanks in advance.

In particular, as you've highlighted, with Bono, but a number of other processes are being reported as failing in the `monit summary` checks. The check on bono is reporting that there is no /etc/init.d/bono present, which should be put in place by the installation; as a first step, I'd suggest ensuring that the package installations completed successfully.

> Once you've done that, for each of the processes that is reporting failure, a good place to start is looking into the logs. The vast majority of our logs are written to files under /var/log/<process_name>/ (e.g. /var/log/bono/bono_20171019T150000Z.txt for bono at that time. Many logs also have <process>_current.txt file tracking the latest log file). Looking at these alongside the /var/log/monit.log file should allow you to get a good idea of what has gone wrong. If a process is not writing any logs, the monit.log should report the failures it is hitting, as it has with bono.

Hi Michele,


The RequestURI XML element is defined in the 3GPP specs as only matching on the hostname - not the full SIP URI. That means that where you have:


               <RequestURI>sip:as2.service.example.com</RequestURI>

 you actually want:


               <RequestURI>as2.service.example.com</RequestURI>

(no "sip:")


With that change, the IFC should match, and this flow should hopefully work as you expect.


Best,

Rob

Subject: [Project Clearwater] Enable AS to AS communication

Hi all,

I have to setup Clearwater to support the following call flow:
user1 <=> AS1 <=> AS2 <=> AS(1 or 3) <=> user2

But I?m missing some configuration to enable AS1 <=> AS2 communication and I need a hint.

Both ASes are internally developed from scratch by my company.

Starting from a clean AIO image, relevant configurations applied are

- dnsmasq.conf
srv-host=_sip._udp.scscf.cw-aio,scscf.cw-aio,5054 srv-host=_sip._udp.as1.service.example.com<http://udp.as1.service.example.com>,example.com<http://example.com>,5071 srv-host=_sip._udp.as2.service.example.com<http://udp.as2.service.example.com>,example.com<http://example.com>,5072
Example Domain<http://example.com/>

Using this configurations, AS1 is correctly addressed for both direct messages and third-party REGISTER,
but messages to AS2 are being rejected with 500. From Sprout log:

P.S.:
Same questions I?ve asked in thread http://lists.projectclearwater.org/pipermail/clearwater_lists.projectclearwater.org/2017-October/003639.html,
but the question was originally another one, so I?m opening a new thread with an appropriate title.

Hi Peter,


Flow tokens are essentially the link between a SIP address and a TCP or UDP connection to the endpoint. When an endpoint REGISTERs, these associations are created and stored in RAM - so when the VM (or the process) restarts, Bono loses that data, and is unable to send calls to the endpoint until it next REGISTERs and re-creates that association.


If you re-register your endpoint after restarting Bono, it should start working again.


Best,

Rob

Subject: [Project Clearwater] Problem after Bono restart


Hi Clearwater,

I am running a manual install Release-89 bono/sprout/homestead/ibcf/dns configuration.

Recently I had need to restart the Bono node (virtual machine).

Following this, INVITE?s from both the external user side, and from the internal network side (from Sprout) were being rejected.

Service was not restored until some time later. I am not certain what restored the service.

Looking at the log file on Bono, it can be seen that the INVITE is rejected because of the lack of a flow token or route request.

Are you able to explain what the flow tokens are, and how they work, and more importantly,

what is the means to restore service after the Bono node has been restarted???

Or do I just have to wait until the flow tokens are recreated? What creates them?

Regards,

Peter





Example on Bono for INVITE from network side (Sprout)?

Hi Robert,
Thank you for your response.


Unfortunately, this change is not enough and I obtain the same 500 response.

To be sure, after the modify I?ve run both
cw-upload_shared_ifcs_xml 
cw-restart_node_processes

Message-ID: <CADS3bmaBh6ymA=QW01HG9-gAToeXZ5dVPxHv-9D49eYgJtaouQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm using AIO on VirtualBox. For clients, I'm using Zoiper on Android
phones.

Both clients can successfully sending out REGISTER, INVITE, 100 TRYING, 180
RINGING......

When Caller makes a call to Callee, Callee can successfully send out a 200
OK to Caller.

But Caller didn't send back a 200 OK to Callee, and that makes Callee keep
showing the interface of incoming call.

The Wireshark trace and the snapshot for sip packets is attached.

**********************************************************
Caller IP: 192.168.208.202
Callee IP: 192.168.208.48
PC IP: 192.168.104.121
**********************************************************

There is a similar problem in archive April 2016, but the answer there says
that it is the problem in client part.

If it is Zoiper's problem, may I ask what kind of softphone apps do you use?

Cause I look through all the Clearwater archives, but it seems every one
can use Zoiper successfully.

As for X-Lite, Bria, Blink and Jitsi, some of them can not set up your own
SIP account, and some even don't exist now.

Best regards,
Alice
