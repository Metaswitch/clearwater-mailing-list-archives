Matvey,

That OID looks to be ending with an IP address.

e.g.
sproutConnectedHomesteadsEntry OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX SproutConnectedHomesteadsEntry
    MAX-ACCESS not-accessible
    STATUS current
    DESCRIPTION "Statistics for a single connected upstream Homestead"
    INDEX { sproutHomesteadInetAddrType,
            sproutHomesteadInetAddr      }
::= { sproutConnectedHomesteadsTable 1 }

The .4 is the Address type (IPv4), and then the next four octets make up the address.

So maybe someone has an up-to-date monitoring setup and willing to share?

BTW, looks like "Chronos" metrics were removed from Sprout. Perhaps completely renamed? Or irrelevant?

Didn't figure out yet, what is the best way to graph the additional Sprout metrics, not present in the template. So maybe someone has a setup, or screenshots...

What about SNMP for SIPp? The Cacti template uses zero-mq, and nothing interesting in SNMP there. Should it work? Or zero-mq only?

Mark, maybe you know: some of the OIDs, which were changed in the above commit, seem to need an additional ".4.110.111.100.101" suffix. Does it have something to do with the commit? Or where could it come from? (For example: .1.2.826.0.1.1578918.9.3.1.1.3.2.4.110.111.100.101. Those which didn't change, don't need this suffix.)

Thanks

Thanks,
so for example:
> snmpwalk -v2c -c clearwater 192.168.37.17:25565<http://192.168.37.17:25565> 1.2.826.0.1.1578918.9.3.1.1.3
produces:
PROJECT-CLEARWATER-MIB::sproutLatencyAverage.scopePrevious5SecondPeriod."node" = Gauge32: 148
PROJECT-CLEARWATER-MIB::sproutLatencyAverage.scopeCurrent5MinutePeriod."node" = Gauge32: 161
PROJECT-CLEARWATER-MIB::sproutLatencyAverage.scopePrevious5MinutePeriod."node" = Gauge32: 139
Am I right to infer, that the .3 in the end, replaces the deprecated .2 (or .2.1) in the end ?
(And that the .2 was a single metric, while the new one comes in 3 aggregations?)

The above seems to be translated from:
.1.2.826.0.1.1578918.9.3.1.1.3.1.4.110.111.100.101 = Gauge32: 148
.1.2.826.0.1.1578918.9.3.1.1.3.2.4.110.111.100.101 = Gauge32: 161
.1.2.826.0.1.1578918.9.3.1.1.3.3.4.110.111.100.101 = Gauge32: 139

So the logic to change the OIDs of the metrics must have been, that they are not 100% backwards compatible?

Instructions for using the correct MIB is at:  https://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Clearwater_SNMP_Statistics.html

If you do create an up to date cacti template, please submit a Pull Request with it (you would need to sign our contributors agreement).

My OIDs seem to be different from the ones in the Cacti templates, for Bono, Sprout etc. Am I doing something wrong?

Does anyone have the correct templates? Maybe a screenshot of your Cacti graphs, please?

Thank you

Thanks, Mark, makes sense. I don't have anything with this IP address
actually, but I get the idea.
Does this mean, however, that I can not  permanently fix the cacti
templates, because this suffix will be different for another Clearwater
deployment?

Another issue: I couldn't get any call stats via SNMP from the SIPp node.
Does it offer anything via SNMP?
And via 0MQ? I tried the "*cw_stat
<https://github.com/Metaswitch/cpp-common/tree/master/scripts/stats>*"
script, but no luck so far. Does SIPp even offer "call_stats" via 0MQ? (The
page has no mention of call_stats.)

The 0MQ port 6666 in the SIPp cacti template suggests it's a Sprout stats.
But does it make sense? Not sure Sprout offers anything via 0MQ either.
(Should I start a new thread on this?)

Message-ID: <78FD7F90-0978-41C2-AABA-F6C8401E5A08@usi.ch>

Hello,

I am trying to deploy Clearwater on openstack using the heat templates in https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-heat.

I followed the guidelines and created a stack giving to both public_mgmt_net_id and public_sig_net_id the id of the external network of my openstack installation. The command executes correctly and Clearwater is deployed. However, I am not able to correctly run the live tests in https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-live-test. When I run them most of them fail and I cannot figure out why. The installation seems ok, all nodes can ping each other and if I run ?sudo monit summary? all the nodes seem ok.

As an example of the errors I am getting, test Basic Call - Mainline (TCP) fails in the following way:
Basic Call - Mainline (TCP) - (6505551643, 6505550739) Failed
Endpoint threw exception:
 - Expected 180, got 503 (call ID b769833afd25631806d564af6c59c2d8)
   - /home/ubuntu/clearwater-live-test/quaff/lib/call.rb:223:in `recv_response'
   - /home/ubuntu/clearwater-live-test/lib/tests/basic-call.rb:38:in `block (2 levels) in <top (required)>'

Test Filtering - Accept-Contact no match (TCP) fails in this way:
Filtering - Accept-Contact no match (TCP) - Failed
  RuntimeError thrown:
   - Account creation failed with HTTP code 502, body {"status": 502, "message": "Bad Gateway", "reason": "Upstream request failed", "detail": {"Upstream error": "502", "Upstream URL": "http://homer-0.faked.dz:7888/org.etsi.ngn.simservs/users/sip%3A6505551397%40faked.dz/simservs.xml"}, "error": true}

Can you help me? I am out of ideas on how to solve this.

Thank you,
Daniele

Hi Daniele,

I don't know the answer to your question without investigating further.

Unfortunately my team are busy for the next couple of week trying to meet a release deadline, so will not be able to look at this until this is complete.
Maybe someone else on the mailing list will be able to help in the meantime.

As soon as our release is delivered, I will get a member of my team to investigate.

Regards

Anne

Thanks for your answer.

In the meantime I can just ask you a simple question to understand better:
I am not using any CCF, and I can see some errors related to that in Ralf logs. Can that be the reason of my problems? In that case, how do I configure my installation to reflect the fact that I don?t need Ralf (https://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Troubleshooting_and_Recovery.html says that if I don?t have CCF I don?t need Ralf).

Thank you,
Daniele
