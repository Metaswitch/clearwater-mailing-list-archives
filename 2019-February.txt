Hi,
Can you please help in establishing client calls in SIP network.
We created a Clearwater All in One AMI in AWS.We also received public identities and password in Ellis.
But we are facing issue while making a call through X-LITE.I am not sure if i missed any configuration.

Please help.
Regards,Prabhakaran

Hi Prabhakaran,

Looking through https://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Making_your_first_call.html and your client config my initial thought is that you have configured your client incorrectly.

You have Server address (under topology) configured to example.com.

However the docs state that for an All-in-One node that this should be configured to <aio-identity>
*         Server: <domain> (or <aio-identity> on an All-in-One node)
Hopefully this will fix your problem.
If not please confirm that

  *   Whether your clients are registering successfully
  *   That you have other config correct i.e. Port, DNS Record.
  *   You are using Zoiper for one of the clients
Regards
Anne

Hi Anne,
Thank you for the email.
I have done the configuration based on your guidance.I have now used Zoiped
   
   - Whether your clients are registering successfully
   
   - Yes
   
   - That you have other config correct i.e. Port, DNS Record.
   
   - Port mentioned in Outpoubd proxy, please see below details from Zoiper
   - DNS record- We are doing All in One Image in AWS , is it still needed
   
   - You are using Zoiper for one of the clients
   
   - Yes
Request you to spare some time in reviewing below details

Prabhakaranm,

Please can you read https://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Making_your_first_call.html fully to be sure you are configuring your clients correctly.

It clearly states that for an All-in-One image that you need to set the DNS record:

If you are using an All-in-One node, you will also need to configure the following at your client.
*         Outbound Proxy
*         Outbound Proxy address: <aio-identity>
*         Port: 5060 (or 8060 if installed in VirtualBox)
*         DNS record for <aio-identity>
Also I am not sure what your <aio-identity> is.

In the initial question your client had Proxy Address set to ec2-3-87......... which looks like the <aio-identity>  you would have if you installed from an Amazon AMI.   However in your latest mail you are setting Domain and Outbound Proxy to an IP address 3.90.15.2277 which would be a different <aio-identity>

Can you please read the document carefully and check you are configuring everything correctly.

If you still have a problem:

  *   Provide details of what you have done at each step.
  *   Confirm registration works
  *   Provide details on what configuration you have on the two clients

Regards

Anne

Subject: [Project Clearwater] MMTEL in a different container
Message-ID: <DM6PR02MB5434CDA1769A453D7B279D27816E0@DM6PR02MB5434.namprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Hi Gabriel,

It is theoretically possible to run the MMTEL AS over a separated container but this is not something we have ever tested.

As to the questions of how to turn on MMTEL services, this is possible using the Ellis Web UI. There should be a tab (or button) in the UI which will give control on a subscriber basis to enable call services i.e. Call barring etc.

If you are still struggling to work out how to do this, can you send a series of screen shots of the different Ellis Web UI pages/tabs and I will try and explain a bit more how to use it.

Regards

Anne

Hi Prabhakaran,

Sorry you are still having problems.

The config you have for the WebRTC looks OK according to https://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/WebRTC_support_in_Clearwater.html

You haven't said what WebRTC client you are using. The first thing to check is that you are using a browser that supports your client. The sipml5 demo using websockets, we have found that calls do not work when we use Chrome, but they do work with recent versions of Firefox.

The second thing that I would look at is whether the websocket request is reaching Bono. I suggest running a packet capture on Bono e.g. using tcpdump, then checking to see whether the packets are making it through your network. You should be able to filter on port 5062. If nothing shows up, then it is worth checking that your firewall is configured correctly. If that does not identify the problem, can you send us debug logs from Bono showing a call? You can find instructions for setting the log level to 5 at https://clearwater.readthedocs.io/en/stable/Troubleshooting_and_Recovery.html#bono

I hope that helps.

Regards,

Anne

Hi Prabhakaran,
I recently used Zoiper (one client on Ubuntu and the other one on Android
phone) and was successfully able to make calls. Can you share your
configuration?

P.S: I followed this document for Zoiper configuration:
https://docs.opencloud.com/ocdoc/books/sentinel-volte-documentation/2.6.0/sentinel-volte-in-the-cloud/sentinel-volte-documentation-2.6.0-sentinel-volte-in-the-cloud.pdf
(Page#46)
