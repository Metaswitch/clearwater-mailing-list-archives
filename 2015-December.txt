Hi Ellie,


I could see installation is completed successful. Even after successful installation, When i open machine(homer & homested) for next time same issue is getting

nc: connect to 127.0.0.1 port 9160 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
Failed to connect to '127.0.0.1:7199': Connection refused
TCP poll failed to 127.0.0.1 9160


so every time it should take couple of mins( for me its taking more than 30mins) to come UP.


one more issue i faced related to cassandra process, Pl find the error below:

nc: connect to 127.0.0.1 port 9160 (tcp) failed: Connection refused
Failed to connect to '127.0.0.1:7199': Connection refused
Cassandra isn't responsive, unable to add schemas
Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.19-0ubuntu6.6) ...
Processing triggers for ureadahead (0.100.0-16) ...
root at homer:/etc#

Could you please help me here to proceed further.

Thanks in advance

Hi Sai,



Do you see the install complete? We?ve got a known issue (see https://github.com/Metaswitch/homestead/issues/269 for details) where this error message can be printed to the terminal, but the install should complete after a couple of minutes.

scheme setup scripts always wait for the grace period during install ? Issue #269 ? Metaswitch/homestead
On initial install, the homestead infrastructure script always waits the grace period since cassandra has not been started.

Hi Sai,



Why are you using our old install process? We have a new process ? detailed at http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/stable/Manual_Install/ ? that takes advantage of our new support for automatic clustering and config sharing. I strongly recommend that you use this process rather than the old one (indeed, I don?t think the old install method will fully work with up-to-date code).

Hi Ellie,



Thanks for your response, I have followed the instructions from below path

http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Old_Manual_Install/index.html



In /etc/clearwater/config-- Kept it default as mentioned in installation steps and not configured any IPs. Once i will install packages of all Modules then will be assigning IPs.



Is this the correct procedure to move further.

Hi,

    I know that the 3rd party registrations are intended as a 
notification, but is there a way to control the Expires time that is 
used? In our case the REGISTER that comes in to Clearwater from the 
device has an Expires value of 3600. The one sent to our application 
server has a value of 300. Can that 300 be changed?

Thanks,

Hi Gavin,

Have you set the value of reg_max_expires in your shared config? This controls the maximum registration length Sprout will allow (default of 300); if a registration request comes in with a higher value then Sprout uses the value of reg_max_expires.

You can see how to change configuration values at http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Modifying_Clearwater_settings/index.html

Hi Ellie,

   The reg_max_expires setting was not in the stock shared_config that 
came with the all-in-one install that we have running, so my search for 
"300" yielded no results, and I missed that particular web page (which I 
have now bookmarked).

Thanks,

Gavin

Hi Sai,



It looks like Cassandra isn?t coming up. Can you please send me your local_config file (in /etc/clearwater), the cassandra log (in /var/log/cassandra/system.log) and let me know the output of clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health?



Thanks,



Ellie

Hi Ellie,



I could see installation is completed successful. Even after successful installation, When i open machine(homer & homested) for next time same issue is getting



nc: connect to 127.0.0.1 port 9160 (tcp) failed: Connection refused

Failed to connect to '127.0.0.1:7199': Connection refused

TCP poll failed to 127.0.0.1 9160



so every time it should take couple of mins( for me its taking more than 30mins) to come UP.



one more issue i faced related to cassandra process, Pl find the error below:



nc: connect to 127.0.0.1 port 9160 (tcp) failed: Connection refused

Failed to connect to '127.0.0.1:7199': Connection refused

Hi Sai,



Do you see the install complete? We?ve got a known issue (see https://github.com/Metaswitch/homestead/issues/269 for details) where this error message can be printed to the terminal, but the install should complete after a couple of minutes.

scheme setup scripts always wait for the grace period during install ? Issue #269 ? Metaswitch/homestead

On initial install, the homestead infrastructure script always waits the grace period since cassandra has not been started.

Hi Sai,



Why are you using our old install process? We have a new process ? detailed at http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/stable/Manual_Install/ ? that takes advantage of our new support for automatic clustering and config sharing. I strongly recommend that you use this process rather than the old one (indeed, I don?t think the old install method will fully work with up-to-date code).

Hi Ellie,



Thanks for your response, I have followed the instructions from below path

http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Old_Manual_Install/index.html



In /etc/clearwater/config-- Kept it default as mentioned in installation steps and not configured any IPs. Once i will install packages of all Modules then will be assigning IPs.



Is this the correct procedure to move further.

Hi Gavin,

This is expected behaviour for ENUM according to the specs (TS 24.229 section 5.4.3.2, S-CSCF requests initiated by the served user)? the way it works is:

?         Originating processing is done, including invoking originating application servers

?         At the end of originating processing, if we have an E.164 number, an ENUM lookup is done to translate it into a SIP URI

?         Terminating processing is then done for that SIP URI (or, if it?s not in the local network, it?s routed out for terminating processing on its home deployment)

This is because:

?         The SIP user sip:+1234 at my.local.domain might not be the same user identified by +1234 on the public telephone network ? although this would be an unusual configuration.

?         It?s possible to use ENUM for call forwarding (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_number_mapping#Call_forwarding), which wouldn?t be possible if ENUM was skipped if the user was known to exist locally.

?         In a large IMS deployment with multiple S-CSCFs, the originating and terminating users might be handled by different S-CSCFs, so a check whether a user existed ?locally? wouldn?t necessarily make sense.

Hope that helps,
Rob

Hi,

   I noticed that if ENUM is enabled, it looks like terminating filters are not checked. Once the originating iFCs are checked, a request to ENUM is sent out, even if the terminating party is a subscriber in the local system. Is this expected, or a known issue (perhaps in the specific release I have installed - Harry Potter)?

Thanks,

Gavin

I see some replies on this list regarding needing to add in NAPTR/SRV

appear fine.  however,  the log in homestead looks a little odd as well:

Subject: [Clearwater] External HSS - Auth Requests not sent to HSS
Date: Fri, 4 Dec 2015 19:31:25 -0500

I am trying to configure/use FHoSS for some testing.  Homestead is
giving me a fit with Auth requeests.  It is not sending requests to the
HSS.  It gives the following in the log:

I see some replies on this list regarding needing to add in NAPTR/SRV
records which I have tried...  The odd issue here is the watchdog
requests are sent periodcly to the HSS and those requests to the HSS
appear fine.  however,  the log in homestead looks a little odd as well:

here is the config file on homestead:

chronos_hostname=localhost:7253
hs_hostname=homestead.example.com:8888
xdms_hostname=homer.example.com:7888

ellis_api_key=secret
ellis_cookie_key=secret

# HSS configuration
hss_hostname=hss.example.com

Any ideas what is missing here?

Hi Sainath,

Have you added the shared configuration file to Ellis yet? Ellis needs this in order to run successfully (but not to install).

Also, how have you set up the etcd cluster on each node? Looking at the etcd_cluster below you don't have the Ellis node being part of the initial etcd cluster. On the initial install your etcd cluster value should be identical on each node (i.e. the etcd_cluster should contain the IP addresses of every initial node). What's the output of running "sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health" and "sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list"?

In the details below you've put the config as being in "/etc/clearwater/local_configuration" - it needs to be in "/etc/clearwater/local_config.

Also, the public hostname looks like it's 'L-185000474', which doesn't look correct at all. Has this just been mangled by the mailing list?

Finally, if none of the above helps can you please send me the Ellis logs (in /var/log/ellis)?

Ellie

The release for sprint "The Three Musketeers" has been cut. The code for this release is tagged as release-87 in github.

This release includes some improvements to most of our Makefiles that should result in our builds being more consistent across our projects, and also quicker.

This release also includes the following bug fixes:

*         Our initial incoming request rate is probably a bad estimate (https://github.com/Metaswitch/sprout/issues/1251)

*         Walking the infinite timer table quickly gives corrupt data (https://github.com/Metaswitch/chronos/issues/185)

*         Prov-tool's infrastructure script requires 'xdms_hostname'  to be configured. (https://github.com/Metaswitch/ellis/issues/144)

*         CASSANDRA_NOT_YET_CLUSTERED alarm is not cleared after rebooting (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-cassandra/issues/61)

*         When upgrading, clearwater-snmp-handler-alarm package is not completely removed (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-snmp-handlers/issues/104)


For upgrading to this release, follow the instructions at http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Upgrading_a_Clearwater_deployment/index.html. If you are deploying an all-in-one node, the standard image (http://vm-images.cw-ngv.com/cw-aio.ova) has been updated for this release.



Thanks,
Graeme

Can you please send me the debug Bono and Sprout logs for a registration attempt?

To turn on debug logging create/edit the file /etc/clearwater/user_settings, add log_level=5 and then restart Sprout/Bono (service <sprout/bono> stop - they're automatically restarted by monit).

Hi Ravichandra,

I can't see any REGISTER attempts in the sprout_* file or the bono_* file. The log_* file shows me that there were some requests rejected with a 401/403, but the timestamp for this log is an hour earlier than the other logs you've sent me.

Can you send me the corresponding sprout_/bono_ logs with the 1600 timestamp, or just simply try registering again and send me the new debug logs?

Hi Ravichandra,


It looks like the Sprout process is unable to contact Homestead (which it needs to in order to check the authentication for the subscriber), so it rejects the Register with a 403.


Can you check that the Homestead process is running (check the output of 'sudo monit summary') and send me the Homestead logs in /var/log/homestead?


Thanks,


Ellie

Hi Ravichandra,



I can?t see any REGISTER attempts in the sprout_* file or the bono_* file. The log_* file shows me that there were some requests rejected with a 401/403, but the timestamp for this log is an hour earlier than the other logs you?ve sent me.



Can you send me the corresponding sprout_/bono_ logs with the 1600 timestamp, or just simply try registering again and send me the new debug logs?



Ellie

Hi Ravichandra,



Can you please send me the debug Bono and Sprout logs for a registration attempt?



To turn on debug logging create/edit the file /etc/clearwater/user_settings, add log_level=5 and then restart Sprout/Bono (service <sprout/bono> stop ? they?re automatically restarted by monit).

Hi Sergey,

Thanks for raising this. We've hit a number of issues with our SNMP statistics recently (e.g. https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-infrastructure/issues/259). These are all fixed up now, and they'll be available in our next release (which will likely be at the start of the next week).

Subject: [Clearwater] Multiple domains in IMS
Message-ID: <CAEAO5tb0FYKg90gX_OiOeSjkJdR2Jusy+pt=173AWVCxYZybUg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have been trying to get two IMS with separate domains to make a call from
one domain to the other, i.e from user1 at dellnfv.com to
user1 at xflowresearch.com. I have done the manual deployment (6 nodes with 1
DNS) via openstack.

I have also configured two IBCF for each IMS and added their IP's in the
trusted peers list in user settings

trusted_peers="10.204.110.86" ( IP of IBCF-0.dellnfv.com)
log_level=4

and,

trusted_peers="10.204.110.91" ( IP of IBCF-0.xflowresearch.com)
log_level=4

I have also configured the routes in the sprout nodes:

{

            }

    ]

}

The problem is I cannot read any traffic when I make a call from dellnfv.com
to xflowresearch.com i.e no logs are generated when in the nodes of
xflowresearch.com. Here are the logs of sprout and bono nodes in dellnfv.com.
Any help will be appreciated.

Hi,

Looking at the logs, it looks like the request is routed correctly until the BGCF sends the request to sip:IBCF.dellnfv.com:5058<http://IBCF.dellnfv.com:5058>, where it then gets stuck.

I think this is because the Bono node doesn?t recognise ?IBCF.dellnfv.com:5058? as itself, so when it receives the INVITE it doesn?t strip the first route header (which is sip:IBCF.dellnfv.com:5058;lr), and instead routes the request on to IBCF.dellnfv.com:5058, so it loops.

Can you try setting the route in the BGCF to the hostname/IP of the IBCF node instead?

If this doesn?t work, can you please send me the debug logs for Bono/Sprout (set log_level = 5 in /etc/clearwater/user_settings, and restart Bono/Sprout (sudo service <sprout|bono> stop ? it?s automatically restarted by monit)).

Also, can you please sign up to the mailing list at http://lists.projectclearwater.org/listinfo/clearwater? This means that your emails will be posted immediately, rather than requiring authorization.

Subject: [Clearwater] Multiple domains in IMS

Hi
I have been trying to get two IMS with separate domains to make a call from one domain to the other, i.e from user1 at dellnfv.com<mailto:user1 at dellnfv.com> to user1 at xflowresearch.com<mailto:user1 at xflowresearch.com>. I have done the manual deployment (6 nodes with 1 DNS) via openstack.

I have also configured two IBCF for each IMS and added their IP's in the trusted peers list in user settings

trusted_peers="10.204.110.86" ( IP of IBCF-0.dellnfv.com<http://IBCF-0.dellnfv.com>)
log_level=4
and,

trusted_peers="10.204.110.91" ( IP of IBCF-0.xflowresearch.com<http://IBCF-0.xflowresearch.com>)
log_level=4
I have also configured the routes in the sprout nodes:

{

    "routes" : [

            { "name" : "Routing to xflowresearch.com<http://xflowresearch.com>",

The problem is I cannot read any traffic when I make a call from dellnfv.com<http://dellnfv.com> to xflowresearch.com<http://xflowresearch.com> i.e no logs are generated when in the nodes of xflowresearch.com<http://xflowresearch.com>. Here are the logs of sprout and bono nodes in dellnfv.com<http://dellnfv.com>. Any help will be appreciated.

Hi Ellie,

Thanks for the quick reply. Setting the route to the IP address of the BGCF
did the trick. I am great full for the support :)

I also wanted to know that in the SIP stress test how many calls are
generated per second/minute? Is there a way to change that?

Best Regards

Hi,

Our stress tests generate a register every 5 minutes, and a call every 30 minutes for each subscriber. The default number of subscribers is 30000.

To change the number of subscribers in the stress run, then do the following on your stress node:

?         Run sudo service clearwater-sip-stress stop

?         Edit /etc/clearwater/local_config and add count=<number of subscribers>

?         Run ?usr/share/clearwater/infrastructure/scripts/sip-stress?

?         Run sudo service clearwater-sip-stress start

You can also change the rate/type of calls by editing the SIPP XML file. This is checked in at https://github.com/Metaswitch/sprout/blob/dev/clearwater-sip-stress.root/usr/share/clearwater/sip-stress/sip-stress.xml, and is installed to /usr/share/clearwater/sip-stress/sip-stress.xml on a stress node.

Hope this helps,

Ellie

Hi Ellie,
Thanks for the quick reply. Setting the route to the IP address of the BGCF did the trick. I am great full for the support :)
I also wanted to know that in the SIP stress test how many calls are generated per second/minute? Is there a way to change that?
Best Regards

Hi,

Looking at the logs, it looks like the request is routed correctly until the BGCF sends the request to sip:IBCF.dellnfv.com:5058<http://IBCF.dellnfv.com:5058>, where it then gets stuck.

I think this is because the Bono node doesn?t recognise ?IBCF.dellnfv.com:5058? as itself, so when it receives the INVITE it doesn?t strip the first route header (which is sip:IBCF.dellnfv.com:5058;lr), and instead routes the request on to IBCF.dellnfv.com:5058<http://IBCF.dellnfv.com:5058>, so it loops.

Can you try setting the route in the BGCF to the hostname/IP of the IBCF node instead?

If this doesn?t work, can you please send me the debug logs for Bono/Sprout (set log_level = 5 in /etc/clearwater/user_settings, and restart Bono/Sprout (sudo service <sprout|bono> stop ? it?s automatically restarted by monit)).

Also, can you please sign up to the mailing list at http://lists.projectclearwater.org/listinfo/clearwater? This means that your emails will be posted immediately, rather than requiring authorization.

Subject: [Clearwater] Multiple domains in IMS

Hi
I have been trying to get two IMS with separate domains to make a call from one domain to the other, i.e from user1 at dellnfv.com<mailto:user1 at dellnfv.com> to user1 at xflowresearch.com<mailto:user1 at xflowresearch.com>. I have done the manual deployment (6 nodes with 1 DNS) via openstack.

I have also configured two IBCF for each IMS and added their IP's in the trusted peers list in user settings

trusted_peers="10.204.110.86" ( IP of IBCF-0.dellnfv.com<http://IBCF-0.dellnfv.com>)
log_level=4
and,

trusted_peers="10.204.110.91" ( IP of IBCF-0.xflowresearch.com<http://IBCF-0.xflowresearch.com>)
log_level=4
I have also configured the routes in the sprout nodes:

{

    "routes" : [

            { "name" : "Routing to xflowresearch.com<http://xflowresearch.com>",

              "domain" : "xflowresearch.com<http://xflowresearch.com>",

              "route"  :
["sip:IBCF.dellnfv.com:5058<http://IBCF.dellnfv.com:5058>","sip:10.204.110.91:5060<http://10.204.110.91:5060>"]

            }

    ]

}

{

    "routes" : [

            { "name" : "Routing to dellnfv.com<http://dellnfv.com>",

              "domain" : "dellnfv.com<http://dellnfv.com>",

              "route"  :
["sip:IBCF.xflowresearch.com:5058<http://IBCF.xflowresearch.com:5058>","sip:10.204.110.86:5060<http://10.204.110.86:5060>"]

            }

    ]

}
The problem is I cannot read any traffic when I make a call from dellnfv.com<http://dellnfv.com> to xflowresearch.com<http://xflowresearch.com> i.e no logs are generated when in the nodes of xflowresearch.com<http://xflowresearch.com>. Here are the logs of sprout and bono nodes in dellnfv.com<http://dellnfv.com>. Any help will be appreciated.

Subject: [Clearwater] Sprout trying to send to BGCF for local uri.
Message-ID: <1450733779.5764.10.camel@interoptechnologies.com>

I have an issue with sprout trying to route a local domain call to a
bgcf.  

local domain = example.com
sprout receives request from sbc.

Here is the log:

Any ideas what is going wrong here?  Also I do not have a bgcf.conf or

Subject: [Clearwater] Sprout trying to send to BGCF for local uri.

Hi, 

You're trying to route to sip:9727531844;phone-context=example.com at example.com;user=phone. This URI represents a telephone number (as user=phone is set and the userpart is numeric). It's also counted as a global number (this isn't technically spec compliant, but we've found that many soft clients don't correctly differentiate between local/global numbers, so enforcing a strict global/local separation breaks routing). If you're confident in the behaviour of your client, or you have an appropriate application server, you can make this more spec compliant by setting the enforce_global_only_lookups flag (see http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/stable/Clearwater_Configuration_Options_Reference/index.html for how to do so).

At the end of originating processing, we've got a URI that we believe represents an E.164 number. We therefore do an ENUM lookup to translate this into a SIP URI (but this fails as you don't have ENUM set up). 

We then start terminating processing for this number. It's still treated as a global number (rather than a local user), so we then route it to the BGCF (the BGCF is present, even if it hasn't been configured).

To fix this for your system, I recommend you enable ENUM (http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/stable/ENUM/index.html). Alternatively, you can set the enforce_global_only_lookups flag described above. 

Hope this helps,

Ellie

I have an issue with sprout trying to route a local domain call to a bgcf.  

local domain = example.com

The release for sprint "Uncle Tom's Cabin" has been cut. The code for this release is tagged as release-88 in github.

In this release we've made some changes to our Chef platform to make it more consistent with our manual install process.

*         For anyone taking the latest version of the Chef code and using it to maintain an existing deployment, the following command should be run to update the roles on each node in your environment. If you do not do this, Chef will be unable to see your deployment, meaning you are unable to delete/modify it through Chef, and Chef may attempt to deploy over the top of it, causing errors.

knife ssh "chef_environment:<environment name>" "sudo chef-client"


This release includes the following bug fixes:

*         Sprout crashes continuously if SAS is not running. (https://github.com/Metaswitch/sprout/issues/1271)

*         snmp_agent.cpp crashing in netsnmp library (https://github.com/Metaswitch/sprout/issues/1157)

*         Calls longer that 1 minute are incomplete in SAS (https://github.com/Metaswitch/sprout/issues/1125)

*         If all ralfs are dead, calls fail (https://github.com/Metaswitch/sprout/issues/1103)

*         HTTP connection pool would stop TCP connect latency from affecting the call path (https://github.com/Metaswitch/sprout/issues/144)

*         eval on start-stop-daemon in homestead's init.d script exceeds line limit? (https://github.com/Metaswitch/homestead/issues/263)

*         chronos_test doesn't use the locally-built libcares (https://github.com/Metaswitch/chronos/issues/209)

*         Stop Ellis in a more targeted way (https://github.com/Metaswitch/ellis/issues/107)

*         Chef not creating Ellis numbers on new deployments (https://github.com/Metaswitch/chef/issues/246)

*         Cassandra sometimes not listening on port 9160 (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-cassandra/issues/26)

*         Attempting to walk a proxied table while the proxy target is down causes snmpd to use 100% CPU forever (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-infrastructure/issues/261)

*         "view excluded" in snmpd.conf doesn't stop us attempting to walk the infinite table (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-infrastructure/issues/259)

*         clearwater_snmp_alarm_agent_restart always fails (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-snmp-handlers/issues/110)

*         Alarm 8500 ("GLOBAL_CONFIG_NOT_SYNCHED") has the wrong "cause" (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-etcd/issues/210)

*         corrupt cassandra.yaml file (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-etcd/issues/207)

*         When an existing node is broken, adding multiple new nodes fails and never recovers (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-etcd/issues/203)

*         check_cluster_state displays different info when sudo'd (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-etcd/issues/167)

*         etcd constantly reports that the cluster_settings changed (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-etcd/issues/160)


For upgrading to this release, follow the instructions at http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Upgrading_a_Clearwater_deployment/index.html. If you are deploying an all-in-one node, the standard image (http://vm-images.cw-ngv.com/cw-aio.ova) has been updated for this release.



Thanks,
Graeme

Hi Ellie,


Yes, I have added shared configuration file to Ellis.


In /etc/clearwater/local_config --> etcd_cluster given as IP's of all other nodes(bono,sprout, homer,homestead & ralf) including Ellis as well.


When i entered command cluster-health & etcdctl member list getting below error:


root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health
Could not determine local IP address
root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list
Could not determine local IP address
root at ellis:/etc/clearwater#

Coming to public hostname given as system's  hostname.

After i was trying to send logs, ellis Logs are not generating in path (in /var/log/ellis), Even after keeping "To turn on debug logging for Ellis, write LOG_LEVEL = logging.DEBUG to the local_settings.py file (at /usr/share/clearwater/ellis/local_settings.py)."

Could you please guide me, am i following correct process.

Thanks in advance!!

Regards,
Sai

Hi Sainath,



Have you added the shared configuration file to Ellis yet? Ellis needs this in order to run successfully (but not to install).



Also, how have you set up the etcd cluster on each node? Looking at the etcd_cluster below you don?t have the Ellis node being part of the initial etcd cluster. On the initial install your etcd cluster value should be identical on each node (i.e. the etcd_cluster should contain the IP addresses of every initial node). What?s the output of running ?sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health? and ?sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list??



In the details below you?ve put the config as being in ?/etc/clearwater/local_configuration? ? it needs to be in ?/etc/clearwater/local_config.



Also, the public hostname looks like it?s ?L-185000474?, which doesn?t look correct at all. Has this just been mangled by the mailing list?



Finally, if none of the above helps can you please send me the Ellis logs (in /var/log/ellis)?



Ellie

Sai,

Ellie is on vacation, so I've picked this up.

Well spotted on the clearwater-etcdctl issue - that could easily be the root cause of all the issues you're seeing.

clearwater-etcdctl only gives the "Could not determine local IP address" if it can't find local_ip in /etc/clearwater/local_config.  As Ellie observed below, it looks like you might have written your local configuration to /etc/clearwater/local_configuration rather than /etc/clearwater/local_config.

Please can you confirm that your configuration is written to /etc/clearwater/local_config and not /etc/clearwater/local_configuration?

Also, it looks as though you might not be subscribed to the mailing list (meaning that you might not see all responses to your question) - you can subscribe at http://lists.projectclearwater.org/mailman/listinfo/clearwater_lists.projectclearwater.org.

Thanks,

Matt

Hi Ellie,



Yes, I have added shared configuration file to Ellis.



In /etc/clearwater/local_config --> etcd_cluster given as IP's of all other nodes(bono,sprout, homer,homestead & ralf) including Ellis as well.



When i entered command cluster-health & etcdctl member list getting below error:


root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health
Could not determine local IP address
root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list
Could not determine local IP address
root at ellis:/etc/clearwater#

Coming to public hostname given as system's  hostname.

After i was trying to send logs, ellis Logs are not generating in path (in /var/log/ellis), Even after keeping "To turn on debug logging for Ellis, write LOG_LEVEL
= logging.DEBUG to the local_settings.py file (at /usr/share/clearwater/ellis/local_settings.py)."

Could you please guide me, am i following correct process.

Thanks in advance!!

Regards,
Sai

Hi Sainath,



Have you added the shared configuration file to Ellis yet? Ellis needs this in order to run successfully (but not to install).



Also, how have you set up the etcd cluster on each node? Looking at the etcd_cluster below you don't have the Ellis node being part of the initial etcd cluster. On the initial install your etcd cluster value should be identical on each node (i.e. the etcd_cluster should contain the IP addresses of every initial node). What's the output of running "sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health" and "sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list"?



In the details below you've put the config as being in "/etc/clearwater/local_configuration" - it needs to be in "/etc/clearwater/local_config.



Also, the public hostname looks like it's 'L-185000474', which doesn't look correct at all. Has this just been mangled by the mailing list?



Finally, if none of the above helps can you please send me the Ellis logs (in /var/log/ellis)?

Sai,

Ellie is on vacation, so I've picked this up.

Well spotted on the clearwater-etcdctl issue - that could easily be the root cause of all the issues you're seeing.

clearwater-etcdctl only gives the "Could not determine local IP address" if it can't find local_ip in /etc/clearwater/local_config.  As Ellie observed below, it looks like you might have written your local configuration to /etc/clearwater/local_configuration rather than /etc/clearwater/local_config.

Please can you confirm that your configuration is written to /etc/clearwater/local_config and not /etc/clearwater/local_configuration?

Also, it looks as though you might not be subscribed to the mailing list (meaning that you might not see all responses to your question) - you can subscribe at http://lists.projectclearwater.org/mailman/listinfo/clearwater_lists.projectclearwater.org.

Thanks,

Matt

Sai,

Thanks for your fast response.  Would you be able to tar up your /etc/clearwater directory and send to me to check the configuration?

Please run "tar zcf etc.clearwater.tar.gz /etc/clearwater" and send me the resulting etc.clearwater.tar.gz file.

Thanks,

Matt

Sai,

Thanks for sharing this.

I think the issue is that your /etc/clearwater/config file is a direct copy of your /etc/clearwater/shared_config file.  The /etc/clearwater/config file is automatically created as part of installing the clearwater-infrastructure package (which all Clearwater components depend on), and includes the /etc/clearwater/local_config and /etc/clearwater/shared_config files.

/etc/clearwater/config should read:

if [ -f /etc/clearwater/shared_config ]
then
  . /etc/clearwater/shared_config
fi

. /etc/clearwater/local_config

if [ -f /etc/clearwater/user_settings ]
then
  . /etc/clearwater/user_settings
fi

Please can you correct it on the ellis node, and check that it's correct on all your other nodes too?

Thanks,

Matt

Sai,



Thanks for your fast response.  Would you be able to tar up your /etc/clearwater directory and send to me to check the configuration?



Please run "tar zcf etc.clearwater.tar.gz /etc/clearwater" and send me the resulting etc.clearwater.tar.gz file.



Thanks,

Sai,



Ellie is on vacation, so I've picked this up.



Well spotted on the clearwater-etcdctl issue - that could easily be the root cause of all the issues you're seeing.



clearwater-etcdctl only gives the "Could not determine local IP address" if it can't find local_ip in /etc/clearwater/local_config.  As Ellie observed below, it looks like you might have written your local configuration to /etc/clearwater/local_configuration rather than /etc/clearwater/local_config.



Please can you confirm that your configuration is written to /etc/clearwater/local_config and not /etc/clearwater/local_configuration?



Also, it looks as though you might not be subscribed to the mailing list (meaning that you might not see all responses to your question) - you can subscribe at http://lists.projectclearwater.org/mailman/listinfo/clearwater_lists.projectclearwater.org.



Thanks,



Matt

Hi Ellie,



Yes, I have added shared configuration file to Ellis.



In /etc/clearwater/local_config --> etcd_cluster given as IP's of all other nodes(bono,sprout, homer,homestead & ralf) including Ellis as well.



When i entered command cluster-health & etcdctl member list getting below error:



root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health

Could not determine local IP address

root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list

Could not determine local IP address

root at ellis:/etc/clearwater#



Coming to public hostname given as system's  hostname.



After i was trying to send logs, ellis Logs are not generating in path (in /var/log/ellis), Even after keeping "To turn on debug logging for Ellis, write LOG_LEVEL

= logging.DEBUG to the local_settings.py file (at /usr/share/clearwater/ellis/local_settings.py)."



Could you please guide me, am i following correct process.



Thanks in advance!!

Hi Sainath,



Have you added the shared configuration file to Ellis yet? Ellis needs this in order to run successfully (but not to install).



Also, how have you set up the etcd cluster on each node? Looking at the etcd_cluster below you don't have the Ellis node being part of the initial etcd cluster. On the initial install your etcd cluster value should be identical on each node (i.e. the etcd_cluster should contain the IP addresses of every initial node). What's the output of running "sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health" and "sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list"?



In the details below you've put the config as being in "/etc/clearwater/local_configuration" - it needs to be in "/etc/clearwater/local_config.



Also, the public hostname looks like it's 'L-185000474', which doesn't look correct at all. Has this just been mangled by the mailing list?



Finally, if none of the above helps can you please send me the Ellis logs (in /var/log/ellis)?

Hi Matt,

I have followed process to install and configuration from below path

http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Manual_Install/index.html  and I could not find anywhere about config file /etc/clearwater/config for configuration.

Process followed for configuration:
On each machine create the file /etc/clearwater/local_config
Log onto any node in the deployment and create the file /etc/clearwater/shared_config

Please correct me if I am wrong and guide me how to proceed further.

Thanks in advance!!

Regards,
Sai

Sai,

Thanks for sharing this.

I think the issue is that your /etc/clearwater/config file is a direct copy of your /etc/clearwater/shared_config file.  The /etc/clearwater/config file is automatically created as part of installing the clearwater-infrastructure package (which all Clearwater components depend on), and includes the /etc/clearwater/local_config and /etc/clearwater/shared_config files.

/etc/clearwater/config should read:

if [ -f /etc/clearwater/shared_config ]
then
  . /etc/clearwater/shared_config
fi

. /etc/clearwater/local_config

if [ -f /etc/clearwater/user_settings ]
then
  . /etc/clearwater/user_settings
fi

Please can you correct it on the ellis node, and check that it's correct on all your other nodes too?

Thanks,

Matt

Subject: RE: Finding problem in making ellis node up



Sai,



Ellie is on vacation, so I've picked this up.



Well spotted on the clearwater-etcdctl issue - that could easily be the root cause of all the issues you're seeing.



clearwater-etcdctl only gives the "Could not determine local IP address" if it can't find local_ip in /etc/clearwater/local_config.  As Ellie observed below, it looks like you might have written your local configuration to /etc/clearwater/local_configuration rather than /etc/clearwater/local_config.



Please can you confirm that your configuration is written to /etc/clearwater/local_config and not /etc/clearwater/local_configuration?



Also, it looks as though you might not be subscribed to the mailing list (meaning that you might not see all responses to your question) - you can subscribe at http://lists.projectclearwater.org/mailman/listinfo/clearwater_lists.projectclearwater.org.



Thanks,



Matt

Hi Ellie,



Yes, I have added shared configuration file to Ellis.



In /etc/clearwater/local_config --> etcd_cluster given as IP's of all other nodes(bono,sprout, homer,homestead & ralf) including Ellis as well.



When i entered command cluster-health & etcdctl member list getting below error:



root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health

Could not determine local IP address

root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list

Could not determine local IP address

root at ellis:/etc/clearwater#



Coming to public hostname given as system's  hostname.



After i was trying to send logs, ellis Logs are not generating in path (in /var/log/ellis), Even after keeping "To turn on debug logging for Ellis, write LOG_LEVEL

= logging.DEBUG to the local_settings.py file (at /usr/share/clearwater/ellis/local_settings.py)."



Could you please guide me, am i following correct process.



Thanks in advance!!



Regards,

Sai

Hi Sainath,



Have you added the shared configuration file to Ellis yet? Ellis needs this in order to run successfully (but not to install).



Also, how have you set up the etcd cluster on each node? Looking at the etcd_cluster below you don't have the Ellis node being part of the initial etcd cluster. On the initial install your etcd cluster value should be identical on each node (i.e. the etcd_cluster should contain the IP addresses of every initial node). What's the output of running "sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health" and "sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list"?



In the details below you've put the config as being in "/etc/clearwater/local_configuration" - it needs to be in "/etc/clearwater/local_config.



Also, the public hostname looks like it's 'L-185000474', which doesn't look correct at all. Has this just been mangled by the mailing list?



Finally, if none of the above helps can you please send me the Ellis logs (in /var/log/ellis)?

Sai,

Thanks for your email.

Yes, you're correct that you shouldn't need to set up /etc/clearwater/config - it should automatically be created to be:

if [ -f /etc/clearwater/shared_config ]
then
  . /etc/clearwater/shared_config
fi

. /etc/clearwater/local_config

if [ -f /etc/clearwater/user_settings ]
then
  . /etc/clearwater/user_settings
fi

However, on your system, the /etc/clearwater/config file is instead an exact copy of /etc/clearwater/shared_config.

Is it possible that you accidentally copied /etc/clearwater/shared_config over /etc/clearwater/config at some point?  If not, maybe there's a bug in Clearwater in which shared_config can be copied over config (although I haven't seen this happen before)?

Please can you try fixing this by replacing your /etc/clearwater/config file with the content above?

Thanks,

Matt

Hi Matt,

I have followed process to install and configuration from below path

http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Manual_Install/index.html  and I could not find anywhere about config file /etc/clearwater/config for configuration.

Process followed for configuration:
On each machine create the file /etc/clearwater/local_config
Log onto any node in the deployment and create the file /etc/clearwater/shared_config

Please correct me if I am wrong and guide me how to proceed further.

Thanks in advance!!

Sai,

Thanks for sharing this.

I think the issue is that your /etc/clearwater/config file is a direct copy of your /etc/clearwater/shared_config file.  The /etc/clearwater/config file is automatically created as part of installing the clearwater-infrastructure package (which all Clearwater components depend on), and includes the /etc/clearwater/local_config and /etc/clearwater/shared_config files.

/etc/clearwater/config should read:

if [ -f /etc/clearwater/shared_config ]
then
  . /etc/clearwater/shared_config
fi

. /etc/clearwater/local_config

if [ -f /etc/clearwater/user_settings ]
then
  . /etc/clearwater/user_settings
fi

Please can you correct it on the ellis node, and check that it's correct on all your other nodes too?

Thanks,

Matt

Thanks for your fast response.  Would you be able to tar up your /etc/clearwater directory and send to me to check the configuration?



Please run "tar zcf etc.clearwater.tar.gz /etc/clearwater" and send me the resulting etc.clearwater.tar.gz file.

Hi Matt,


Thanks for your response.


I have updated below changes to Ellis as well to all nodes.


Facing another issue in Sprout, Homer & homestead process. As sprout_process, Homer_process, Homestead_process as well as cassandra process for all three nodes are not coming UP.


Followed steps from http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Manual_Install/index.html


Configuration done same as Ellis and Bono.


Could you please guide me how to proceed further.


Thanks in advance!!


Regards,

Sai,



Thanks for your email.



Yes, you're correct that you shouldn't need to set up /etc/clearwater/config - it should automatically be created to be:



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/shared_config ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/shared_config

fi



. /etc/clearwater/local_config



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/user_settings ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/user_settings

fi



However, on your system, the /etc/clearwater/config file is instead an exact copy of /etc/clearwater/shared_config.



Is it possible that you accidentally copied /etc/clearwater/shared_config over /etc/clearwater/config at some point?  If not, maybe there's a bug in Clearwater in which shared_config can be copied over config (although I haven't seen this happen before)?



Please can you try fixing this by replacing your /etc/clearwater/config file with the content above?



Thanks,



Matt

Hi Matt,



I have followed process to install and configuration from below path



http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Manual_Install/index.html  and I could not find anywhere about config file

Manual Install - Clearwater Docs Home<http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Manual_Install/index.html>
clearwater.readthedocs.org
Manual Install Instructions. These instructions will take you through installing a minimal Clearwater system using the latest binary packages provided by the ...


/etc/clearwater/config for configuration.



Process followed for configuration:

On each machine create the file /etc/clearwater/local_config

Log onto any node in the deployment and create the file /etc/clearwater/shared_config



Please correct me if I am wrong and guide me how to proceed further.



Thanks in advance!!

Sai,



Thanks for sharing this.



I think the issue is that your /etc/clearwater/config file is a direct copy of your /etc/clearwater/shared_config file.  The /etc/clearwater/config file is automatically created as part of installing the clearwater-infrastructure package (which all Clearwater components depend on), and includes the /etc/clearwater/local_config and /etc/clearwater/shared_config files.



/etc/clearwater/config should read:



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/shared_config ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/shared_config

fi



. /etc/clearwater/local_config



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/user_settings ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/user_settings

fi



Please can you correct it on the ellis node, and check that it's correct on all your other nodes too?



Thanks,



Matt

Sai,



Ellie is on vacation, so I've picked this up.



Well spotted on the clearwater-etcdctl issue - that could easily be the root cause of all the issues you're seeing.



clearwater-etcdctl only gives the "Could not determine local IP address" if it can't find local_ip in /etc/clearwater/local_config.  As Ellie observed below, it looks like you might have written your local configuration to /etc/clearwater/local_configuration rather than /etc/clearwater/local_config.



Please can you confirm that your configuration is written to /etc/clearwater/local_config and not /etc/clearwater/local_configuration?



Also, it looks as though you might not be subscribed to the mailing list (meaning that you might not see all responses to your question) - you can subscribe at http://lists.projectclearwater.org/mailman/listinfo/clearwater_lists.projectclearwater.org.



Thanks,



Matt

Hi Ellie,



Yes, I have added shared configuration file to Ellis.



In /etc/clearwater/local_config --> etcd_cluster given as IP's of all other nodes(bono,sprout, homer,homestead & ralf) including Ellis as well.



When i entered command cluster-health & etcdctl member list getting below error:



root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health

Could not determine local IP address

root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list

Could not determine local IP address

root at ellis:/etc/clearwater#



Coming to public hostname given as system's  hostname.



After i was trying to send logs, ellis Logs are not generating in path (in /var/log/ellis), Even after keeping "To turn on debug logging for Ellis, write LOG_LEVEL

= logging.DEBUG to the local_settings.py file (at /usr/share/clearwater/ellis/local_settings.py)."



Could you please guide me, am i following correct process.



Thanks in advance!!

Hi Sainath,



Have you added the shared configuration file to Ellis yet? Ellis needs this in order to run successfully (but not to install).



Also, how have you set up the etcd cluster on each node? Looking at the etcd_cluster below you don?t have the Ellis node being part of the initial etcd cluster. On the initial install your etcd cluster value should be identical on each node (i.e. the etcd_cluster should contain the IP addresses of every initial node). What?s the output of running ?sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health? and ?sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list??



In the details below you?ve put the config as being in ?/etc/clearwater/local_configuration? ? it needs to be in ?/etc/clearwater/local_config.



Also, the public hostname looks like it?s ?L-185000474?, which doesn?t look correct at all. Has this just been mangled by the mailing list?



Finally, if none of the above helps can you please send me the Ellis logs (in /var/log/ellis)?

Sai,

Thanks for your email.  Please can you share the diagnostics?

For Sprout, please can you gather /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt?

For Homer and Homestead, I suspect that Cassandra is the root cause.  Please can you gather the contents of /var/log/cassandra?

Also, you say that Cassandra is not coming up on Sprout.  Is that correct?  Unless you've also installed Memento (https://github.com/Metaswitch/memento), Sprout shouldn't be running Cassandra - please can you confirm?

Thanks,

Matt

Hi Matt,



Thanks for your response.



I have updated below changes to Ellis as well to all nodes.



Facing another issue in Sprout, Homer & homestead process. As sprout_process, Homer_process, Homestead_process as well as cassandra process for all three nodes are not coming UP.



Followed steps from http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Manual_Install/index.html



Configuration done same as Ellis and Bono.



Could you please guide me how to proceed further.



Thanks in advance!!

= logging.DEBUG to the local_settings.py file (at /usr/share/clearwater/ellis/local_settings.py)."



Could you please guide me, am i following correct process.



Thanks in advance!!

Hi Sainath,



Have you added the shared configuration file to Ellis yet? Ellis needs this in order to run successfully (but not to install).



Also, how have you set up the etcd cluster on each node? Looking at the etcd_cluster below you don't have the Ellis node being part of the initial etcd cluster. On the initial install your etcd cluster value should be identical on each node (i.e. the etcd_cluster should contain the IP addresses of every initial node). What's the output of running "sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health" and "sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list"?



In the details below you've put the config as being in "/etc/clearwater/local_configuration" - it needs to be in "/etc/clearwater/local_config.



Also, the public hostname looks like it's 'L-185000474', which doesn't look correct at all. Has this just been mangled by the mailing list?



Finally, if none of the above helps can you please send me the Ellis logs (in /var/log/ellis)?



Ellie

Hi,

Thanks for your email.

I'm not sure we've ever tried connecting to Skype Connect.  Do you know what the expected SIP flows are?

A quick read of the documentation (https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10574/what-authentication-methods-are-available-with-skype-connect) suggests that it's possible to configure Skype Connect for "SIP registration" or "IP authentication".  In the "SIP registration" case, Clearwater would have to send a REGISTER to Skype - since Clearwater is an IMS core rather than a PBX, it doesn't support that.  However, the "IP authentication" case might work.

I would suggest configuring a Bono node to act as an IBCF (http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/stable/IBCF/index.html) and giving Skype Connect the IP address of this node.  If it doesn't "just work", I'd suggest turning on low-level logging in Bono and Sprout and examining /var/log/bono/bono_current.txt and /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt (http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/stable/Troubleshooting_and_Recovery/index.html#bono and http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/stable/Troubleshooting_and_Recovery/index.html#sprout) as these will show the SIP flows that occur.

Good luck, and please let us know how you get on!

Thanks,

Matt

Sai,

Thanks for these diagnostics.

The key Sprout log (from /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt) is:

12-12-2015 17:35:44.664 UTC Error stack.cpp:222: Failed to decode IP address L-185000474 (gethostbyname() has returned error (PJ_ERESOLVE))
12-12-2015 17:35:44.665 UTC Error pjsip: Assert failed: stack.cpp:739 status == 0

Basically, this is saying that it's trying to resolve the "public_hostname" configuration option (which is set to "L-185000474").  As Ellie observed below, this looks odd (and the trace shows that it can't be resolved).  Please can you check and correct this configuration?  It must be resolvable by Sprout itself.

For Cassandra, the issue is that the OOM (out-of-memory) killer is killing the Cassandra process because it's taking up too much memory.  We can see this from /var/log/syslog:

Dec 11 23:13:21 sprout kernel: [   63.260285] clearwater-etcd invoked oom-killer: gfp_mask=0x200da, order=0, oom_score_adj=0
Dec 11 23:13:21 sprout kernel: [   63.260290] clearwater-etcd cpuset=/ mems_allowed=0
Dec 11 23:13:21 sprout kernel: [   63.260297] CPU: 0 PID: 2602 Comm: clearwater-etcd Not tainted 3.16.0-30-generic #40~14.04.1-Ubuntu

To run cleanly, Clearwater nodes need ~2 GB RAM (http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/stable/Manual_Install/ says "EC2 t2.small", which I will clarify).  The meminfo.txt file in the diagnostics bundle suggests that you're running on a VM with 0.5 GB RAM + 0.5 GB swap.  Please can you increase the RAM available to this VM?

Thanks,

Matt

Sai,



Thanks for your email.  Please can you share the diagnostics?



For Sprout, please can you gather /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt?



For Homer and Homestead, I suspect that Cassandra is the root cause.  Please can you gather the contents of /var/log/cassandra?



Also, you say that Cassandra is not coming up on Sprout.  Is that correct?  Unless you've also installed Memento (https://github.com/Metaswitch/memento), Sprout shouldn't be running Cassandra - please can you confirm?




Thanks,



Matt

Hi Matt,



Thanks for your response.



I have updated below changes to Ellis as well to all nodes.



Facing another issue in Sprout, Homer & homestead process. As sprout_process, Homer_process, Homestead_process as well as cassandra process for all three nodes are not coming UP.



Followed steps from http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Manual_Install/index.html



Configuration done same as Ellis and Bono.



Could you please guide me how to proceed further.



Thanks in advance!!

Sai,



Thanks for your email.



Yes, you're correct that you shouldn't need to set up /etc/clearwater/config - it should automatically be created to be:



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/shared_config ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/shared_config

fi



. /etc/clearwater/local_config



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/user_settings ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/user_settings

fi



However, on your system, the /etc/clearwater/config file is instead an exact copy of /etc/clearwater/shared_config.



Is it possible that you accidentally copied /etc/clearwater/shared_config over /etc/clearwater/config at some point?  If not, maybe there's a bug in Clearwater in which shared_config can be copied over config (although I haven't seen this happen before)?



Please can you try fixing this by replacing your /etc/clearwater/config file with the content above?



Thanks,



Matt

Sai,



Thanks for sharing this.



I think the issue is that your /etc/clearwater/config file is a direct copy of your /etc/clearwater/shared_config file.  The /etc/clearwater/config file is automatically created as part of installing the clearwater-infrastructure package (which all Clearwater components depend on), and includes the /etc/clearwater/local_config and /etc/clearwater/shared_config files.



/etc/clearwater/config should read:



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/shared_config ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/shared_config

fi



. /etc/clearwater/local_config



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/user_settings ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/user_settings

fi



Please can you correct it on the ellis node, and check that it's correct on all your other nodes too?



Thanks,



Matt

Sai,



Ellie is on vacation, so I've picked this up.



Well spotted on the clearwater-etcdctl issue - that could easily be the root cause of all the issues you're seeing.



clearwater-etcdctl only gives the "Could not determine local IP address" if it can't find local_ip in /etc/clearwater/local_config.  As Ellie observed below, it looks like you might have written your local configuration to /etc/clearwater/local_configuration rather than /etc/clearwater/local_config.



Please can you confirm that your configuration is written to /etc/clearwater/local_config and not /etc/clearwater/local_configuration?



Also, it looks as though you might not be subscribed to the mailing list (meaning that you might not see all responses to your question) - you can subscribe at http://lists.projectclearwater.org/mailman/listinfo/clearwater_lists.projectclearwater.org.



Thanks,



Matt

Could you please guide me, am i following correct process.



Thanks in advance!!

Hi Sainath,



Have you added the shared configuration file to Ellis yet? Ellis needs this in order to run successfully (but not to install).



Also, how have you set up the etcd cluster on each node? Looking at the etcd_cluster below you don't have the Ellis node being part of the initial etcd cluster. On the initial install your etcd cluster value should be identical on each node (i.e. the etcd_cluster should contain the IP addresses of every initial node). What's the output of running "sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health" and "sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list"?



In the details below you've put the config as being in "/etc/clearwater/local_configuration" - it needs to be in "/etc/clearwater/local_config.



Also, the public hostname looks like it's 'L-185000474', which doesn't look correct at all. Has this just been mangled by the mailing list?



Finally, if none of the above helps can you please send me the Ellis logs (in /var/log/ellis)?



Ellie

Sai,

Thanks for your email.

Please can you check your configuration?

*         Sprout's public_hostname is now set to "sprout".  Please can you confirm that this resolves locally?  Check /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt for the "Failed to decode IP address" log we saw before.  If this does resolve locally, please share /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt.

*         I notice that /etc/clearwater/shared_config's xdms_hostname variable is set to homer.pes, not homer.pes.com - that won't be the problem, but please can you fix it?

*         Memento isn't starting because Cassandra isn't running (or at least not running stably).

*         It looks as though Cassandra is cyclically restarting in the same way that we saw on the Homestead and Homer nodes.  Please can you check that your Sprout node has enough RAM too?  (If it does have enough RAM, it's possible that something else is causing it to restart - in this case, sharing /var/log/syslog and /var/log/monit.log would help.)

*         For some reason, etcd is not running.  Please can you share /var/log/clearwater-etcd/clearwater-etcd.log.*?

Thanks,

Matt

Now i am facing problem to make sprout node UP.

Sai,



Thanks for these diagnostics.



The key Sprout log (from /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt) is:



12-12-2015 17:35:44.664 UTC Error stack.cpp:222: Failed to decode IP address L-185000474 (gethostbyname() has returned error (PJ_ERESOLVE))

12-12-2015 17:35:44.665 UTC Error pjsip: Assert failed: stack.cpp:739 status == 0



Basically, this is saying that it's trying to resolve the "public_hostname" configuration option (which is set to "L-185000474").  As Ellie observed below, this looks odd (and the trace shows that it can't be resolved).  Please can you check and correct this configuration?  It must be resolvable by Sprout itself.



For Cassandra, the issue is that the OOM (out-of-memory) killer is killing the Cassandra process because it's taking up too much memory.  We can see this from /var/log/syslog:



Dec 11 23:13:21 sprout kernel: [   63.260285] clearwater-etcd invoked oom-killer: gfp_mask=0x200da, order=0, oom_score_adj=0

To run cleanly, Clearwater nodes need ~2 GB RAM (http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/stable/Manual_Install/ says "EC2 t2.small", which I will clarify).  The meminfo.txt file in the diagnostics bundle suggests that you're running on a VM with 0.5 GB RAM + 0.5 GB swap.  Please can you increase the RAM available to this VM?

Sai,



Thanks for your email.  Please can you share the diagnostics?



For Sprout, please can you gather /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt?



For Homer and Homestead, I suspect that Cassandra is the root cause.  Please can you gather the contents of /var/log/cassandra?



Also, you say that Cassandra is not coming up on Sprout.  Is that correct?  Unless you've also installed Memento (https://github.com/Metaswitch/memento), Sprout shouldn't be running Cassandra - please can you confirm?





Thanks,



Matt

Hi Matt,



Thanks for your response.



I have updated below changes to Ellis as well to all nodes.



Facing another issue in Sprout, Homer & homestead process. As sprout_process, Homer_process, Homestead_process as well as cassandra process for all three nodes are not coming UP.



Followed steps from http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Manual_Install/index.html



Configuration done same as Ellis and Bono.



Could you please guide me how to proceed further.



Thanks in advance!!

Sai,



Thanks for your email.



Yes, you're correct that you shouldn't need to set up /etc/clearwater/config - it should automatically be created to be:



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/shared_config ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/shared_config

fi



. /etc/clearwater/local_config



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/user_settings ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/user_settings

fi



However, on your system, the /etc/clearwater/config file is instead an exact copy of /etc/clearwater/shared_config.



Is it possible that you accidentally copied /etc/clearwater/shared_config over /etc/clearwater/config at some point?  If not, maybe there's a bug in Clearwater in which shared_config can be copied over config (although I haven't seen this happen before)?



Please can you try fixing this by replacing your /etc/clearwater/config file with the content above?



Thanks,



Matt

Sai,



Thanks for sharing this.



I think the issue is that your /etc/clearwater/config file is a direct copy of your /etc/clearwater/shared_config file.  The /etc/clearwater/config file is automatically created as part of installing the clearwater-infrastructure package (which all Clearwater components depend on), and includes the /etc/clearwater/local_config and /etc/clearwater/shared_config files.



/etc/clearwater/config should read:



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/shared_config ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/shared_config

fi



. /etc/clearwater/local_config



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/user_settings ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/user_settings

fi



Please can you correct it on the ellis node, and check that it's correct on all your other nodes too?



Thanks,



Matt

Sai,



Ellie is on vacation, so I've picked this up.



Well spotted on the clearwater-etcdctl issue - that could easily be the root cause of all the issues you're seeing.



clearwater-etcdctl only gives the "Could not determine local IP address" if it can't find local_ip in /etc/clearwater/local_config.  As Ellie observed below, it looks like you might have written your local configuration to /etc/clearwater/local_configuration rather than /etc/clearwater/local_config.



Please can you confirm that your configuration is written to /etc/clearwater/local_config and not /etc/clearwater/local_configuration?



Also, it looks as though you might not be subscribed to the mailing list (meaning that you might not see all responses to your question) - you can subscribe at http://lists.projectclearwater.org/mailman/listinfo/clearwater_lists.projectclearwater.org.



Thanks,



Matt

Subject: Re: [Clearwater] Finding problem in making ellis node up



Hi Ellie,



Yes, I have added shared configuration file to Ellis.



In /etc/clearwater/local_config --> etcd_cluster given as IP's of all other nodes(bono,sprout, homer,homestead & ralf) including Ellis as well.



When i entered command cluster-health & etcdctl member list getting below error:



root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health

Could not determine local IP address

root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list

Could not determine local IP address

root at ellis:/etc/clearwater#



Coming to public hostname given as system's  hostname.



After i was trying to send logs, ellis Logs are not generating in path (in /var/log/ellis), Even after keeping "To turn on debug logging for Ellis, write LOG_LEVEL

= logging.DEBUG to the local_settings.py file (at /usr/share/clearwater/ellis/local_settings.py)."



Could you please guide me, am i following correct process.



Thanks in advance!!



Regards,

Sai

Hi Sainath,



Have you added the shared configuration file to Ellis yet? Ellis needs this in order to run successfully (but not to install).



Also, how have you set up the etcd cluster on each node? Looking at the etcd_cluster below you don't have the Ellis node being part of the initial etcd cluster. On the initial install your etcd cluster value should be identical on each node (i.e. the etcd_cluster should contain the IP addresses of every initial node). What's the output of running "sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health" and "sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list"?



In the details below you've put the config as being in "/etc/clearwater/local_configuration" - it needs to be in "/etc/clearwater/local_config.



Also, the public hostname looks like it's 'L-185000474', which doesn't look correct at all. Has this just been mangled by the mailing list?



Finally, if none of the above helps can you please send me the Ellis logs (in /var/log/ellis)?



Ellie

Sai,

Thanks for these diagnostics.

monit.log shows that it's killing Sprout (and Memento) because it can't poll it.  The reason it can't poll it is that it can't find the "local_ip" parameter in /etc/clearwater/config.  Double-checking the configuration files you sent me yesterday, /etc/clearwater/config reads:


cal_ip=192.168.56.12
public_ip=192.168.56.12
public_hostname=sprout
etcd_cluster="192.168.56.10,192.168.56.11,192.168.56.12,192.168.56.13,192.168.56.14,192.168.56.15"

So it looks as though you've lost the first two characters of "local_ip".  Please can you fix this up and double-check all the configuration files?  (It's really important that all the configuration files are intact.)  I've raised an issue (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-infrastructure/issues/282) to consider whether we should do more up-front configuration checking to pick up this kind of misconfiguration earlier.

Looking at the clearwater-etcd.log file, we see it complaining that 2 URLs don't match because one does not contain a hostname/IP address.  This is also because the local_ip isn't set.  I'm not completely sure that fixing this will fix etcd, but it's worth fixing the local_ip issue and then seeing if the etcd problem goes away.

BTW, it looks as though your Sprout node isn't synchronized to NTP.  (There are logs in syslog about "ntpd_intres[4985]: host name not found: 0.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org".)  This isn't a problem at this stage, but it makes reading the diagnostics a bit difficult - the sprout VM thinks the current date is December 14!  Please can you take a look?

Thanks,

Matt

Hi Matt,



Thanks for your response.



1) Yes, Sprout's public_hostname is set to sprout and it got resolved locally. Please find the attachment of  /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt.

2) In Shared_config xdms variable is now changed to homer.pes.com

3) I have assigned 2GB RAM for sprout node, As i did for Homer & Homestead. Please find attachment of /var/log/syslog and /var/log/monit.log.

4) Please find attachment of etcd logs /var/log/clearwater-etcd/clearwater-etcd.log.



Thanks in advance!!

Sai

Sai,



Thanks for your email.



Please can you check your configuration?

*         Sprout's public_hostname is now set to "sprout".  Please can you confirm that this resolves locally?  Check /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt for the "Failed to decode IP address" log we saw before.  If this does resolve locally, please share /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt.

*         I notice that /etc/clearwater/shared_config's xdms_hostname variable is set to homer.pes, not homer.pes.com - that won't be the problem, but please can you fix it?

*         Memento isn't starting because Cassandra isn't running (or at least not running stably).

*         It looks as though Cassandra is cyclically restarting in the same way that we saw on the Homestead and Homer nodes.  Please can you check that your Sprout node has enough RAM too?  (If it does have enough RAM, it's possible that something else is causing it to restart - in this case, sharing /var/log/syslog and /var/log/monit.log would help.)

*         For some reason, etcd is not running.  Please can you share /var/log/clearwater-etcd/clearwater-etcd.log.*?



Thanks,



Matt

Hi Matt,



Thanks for your response..



Now i am facing problem to make sprout node UP.



Pls find the output of monit summary below:

Sai,



Thanks for these diagnostics.



The key Sprout log (from /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt) is:



12-12-2015 17:35:44.664 UTC Error stack.cpp:222: Failed to decode IP address L-185000474 (gethostbyname() has returned error (PJ_ERESOLVE))

12-12-2015 17:35:44.665 UTC Error pjsip: Assert failed: stack.cpp:739 status == 0



Basically, this is saying that it's trying to resolve the "public_hostname" configuration option (which is set to "L-185000474").  As Ellie observed below, this looks odd (and the trace shows that it can't be resolved).  Please can you check and correct this configuration?  It must be resolvable by Sprout itself.



For Cassandra, the issue is that the OOM (out-of-memory) killer is killing the Cassandra process because it's taking up too much memory.  We can see this from /var/log/syslog:

To run cleanly, Clearwater nodes need ~2 GB RAM (http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/stable/Manual_Install/ says "EC2 t2.small", which I will clarify).  The meminfo.txt file in the diagnostics bundle suggests that you're running on a VM with 0.5 GB RAM + 0.5 GB swap.  Please can you increase the RAM available to this VM?

Sai,



Thanks for your email.  Please can you share the diagnostics?



For Sprout, please can you gather /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt?



For Homer and Homestead, I suspect that Cassandra is the root cause.  Please can you gather the contents of /var/log/cassandra?



Also, you say that Cassandra is not coming up on Sprout.  Is that correct?  Unless you've also installed Memento (https://github.com/Metaswitch/memento), Sprout shouldn't be running Cassandra - please can you confirm?





Thanks,



Matt

Hi Matt,



Thanks for your response.



I have updated below changes to Ellis as well to all nodes.



Facing another issue in Sprout, Homer & homestead process. As sprout_process, Homer_process, Homestead_process as well as cassandra process for all three nodes are not coming UP.



Followed steps from http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Manual_Install/index.html



Configuration done same as Ellis and Bono.



Could you please guide me how to proceed further.



Thanks in advance!!



Regards,

Sai

Sai,



Thanks for your email.



Yes, you're correct that you shouldn't need to set up /etc/clearwater/config - it should automatically be created to be:



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/shared_config ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/shared_config

fi



. /etc/clearwater/local_config



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/user_settings ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/user_settings

fi



However, on your system, the /etc/clearwater/config file is instead an exact copy of /etc/clearwater/shared_config.



Is it possible that you accidentally copied /etc/clearwater/shared_config over /etc/clearwater/config at some point?  If not, maybe there's a bug in Clearwater in which shared_config can be copied over config (although I haven't seen this happen before)?



Please can you try fixing this by replacing your /etc/clearwater/config file with the content above?



Thanks,



Matt

Manual Install Instructions. These instructions will take you through installing a minimal Clearwater system using the latest binary packages provided by the ...


/etc/clearwater/config for configuration.



Process followed for configuration:

On each machine create the file /etc/clearwater/local_config

Log onto any node in the deployment and create the file /etc/clearwater/shared_config



Please correct me if I am wrong and guide me how to proceed further.



Thanks in advance!!

Sai,



Thanks for sharing this.



I think the issue is that your /etc/clearwater/config file is a direct copy of your /etc/clearwater/shared_config file.  The /etc/clearwater/config file is automatically created as part of installing the clearwater-infrastructure package (which all Clearwater components depend on), and includes the /etc/clearwater/local_config and /etc/clearwater/shared_config files.



/etc/clearwater/config should read:



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/shared_config ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/shared_config

fi



. /etc/clearwater/local_config



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/user_settings ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/user_settings

fi



Please can you correct it on the ellis node, and check that it's correct on all your other nodes too?



Thanks,



Matt

Sai,



Thanks for your fast response.  Would you be able to tar up your /etc/clearwater directory and send to me to check the configuration?



Please run "tar zcf etc.clearwater.tar.gz /etc/clearwater" and send me the resulting etc.clearwater.tar.gz file.



Thanks,

Sai,



Ellie is on vacation, so I've picked this up.



Well spotted on the clearwater-etcdctl issue - that could easily be the root cause of all the issues you're seeing.



clearwater-etcdctl only gives the "Could not determine local IP address" if it can't find local_ip in /etc/clearwater/local_config.  As Ellie observed below, it looks like you might have written your local configuration to /etc/clearwater/local_configuration rather than /etc/clearwater/local_config.



Please can you confirm that your configuration is written to /etc/clearwater/local_config and not /etc/clearwater/local_configuration?



Also, it looks as though you might not be subscribed to the mailing list (meaning that you might not see all responses to your question) - you can subscribe at http://lists.projectclearwater.org/mailman/listinfo/clearwater_lists.projectclearwater.org.



Thanks,



Matt

Hi Ellie,



Yes, I have added shared configuration file to Ellis.



In /etc/clearwater/local_config --> etcd_cluster given as IP's of all other nodes(bono,sprout, homer,homestead & ralf) including Ellis as well.



When i entered command cluster-health & etcdctl member list getting below error:



root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health

Could not determine local IP address

root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list

Could not determine local IP address

root at ellis:/etc/clearwater#



Coming to public hostname given as system's  hostname.



After i was trying to send logs, ellis Logs are not generating in path (in /var/log/ellis), Even after keeping "To turn on debug logging for Ellis, write LOG_LEVEL

= logging.DEBUG to the local_settings.py file (at /usr/share/clearwater/ellis/local_settings.py)."



Could you please guide me, am i following correct process.



Thanks in advance!!

Hi Sainath,



Have you added the shared configuration file to Ellis yet? Ellis needs this in order to run successfully (but not to install).



Also, how have you set up the etcd cluster on each node? Looking at the etcd_cluster below you don't have the Ellis node being part of the initial etcd cluster. On the initial install your etcd cluster value should be identical on each node (i.e. the etcd_cluster should contain the IP addresses of every initial node). What's the output of running "sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health" and "sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list"?



In the details below you've put the config as being in "/etc/clearwater/local_configuration" - it needs to be in "/etc/clearwater/local_config.



Also, the public hostname looks like it's 'L-185000474', which doesn't look correct at all. Has this just been mangled by the mailing list?



Finally, if none of the above helps can you please send me the Ellis logs (in /var/log/ellis)?



Ellie

Hi Matt,



Thanks for your quick response.



I have missed the below while copying config file. Modified the below missing characters and now its running fine.



I was trying to setting up S-CSCF configuration copied the content below into /etc/clearwater/s-cscf.json



{
   "s-cscfs" : [
       {   "server" : "sip:pes.com:5054;transport=TCP",
           "priority" : 0,
           "weight" : 100,
           "capabilities" : [<comma separated capabilities>]
       }
   ]
}


Then I have executed command : sudo /usr/share/clearwater/clearwater-config-manager/scripts/upload_scscf_json getting below error


Upload JSON configuration file failed to http://192.168.56.12:4000/v2/keys/clearwater/site1/configuration/scscf_json
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current

{"message":"Internal Server Error"}root at sprout:/etc/clearwater#



And sometimes when I was connecting to sprout, homer & homestead nodes observed below error then after couple of seconds this error is not observed.

nc: connect to 127.0.0.1 port 9160 (tcp) failed: Connection refused

Failed to connect to '127.0.0.1:7199': Connection refused

TCP poll failed to 127.0.0.1 9160



The current date is showing as December 14 is correct only.. As I forget update the VM timing at the time of installation, With this any issue occur further??


Thanks in advance!!

Sai

Subject: RE: Finding problem in making ellis node up



Sai,



Thanks for these diagnostics.



monit.log shows that it's killing Sprout (and Memento) because it can't poll it.  The reason it can't poll it is that it can't find the "local_ip" parameter in /etc/clearwater/config.  Double-checking the configuration files you sent me yesterday, /etc/clearwater/config reads:





cal_ip=192.168.56.12

public_ip=192.168.56.12

public_hostname=sprout

etcd_cluster="192.168.56.10,192.168.56.11,192.168.56.12,192.168.56.13,192.168.56.14,192.168.56.15"



So it looks as though you've lost the first two characters of "local_ip".  Please can you fix this up and double-check all the configuration files?  (It's really important that all the configuration files are intact.)  I've raised an issue (https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-infrastructure/issues/282) to consider whether we should do more up-front configuration checking to pick up this kind of misconfiguration earlier.



Looking at the clearwater-etcd.log file, we see it complaining that 2 URLs don't match because one does not contain a hostname/IP address.  This is also because the local_ip isn't set.  I'm not completely sure that fixing this will fix etcd, but it's worth fixing the local_ip issue and then seeing if the etcd problem goes away.



BTW, it looks as though your Sprout node isn't synchronized to NTP.  (There are logs in syslog about "ntpd_intres[4985]: host name not found: 0.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org".)  This isn't a problem at this stage, but it makes reading the diagnostics a bit difficult - the sprout VM thinks the current date is December 14!  Please can you take a look?



Thanks,



Matt

Hi Matt,



Thanks for your response.



1) Yes, Sprout's public_hostname is set to sprout and it got resolved locally. Please find the attachment of  /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt.

2) In Shared_config xdms variable is now changed to homer.pes.com

3) I have assigned 2GB RAM for sprout node, As i did for Homer & Homestead. Please find attachment of /var/log/syslog and /var/log/monit.log.

4) Please find attachment of etcd logs /var/log/clearwater-etcd/clearwater-etcd.log.



Thanks in advance!!

Sai,



Thanks for your email.



Please can you check your configuration?

*         Sprout's public_hostname is now set to "sprout".  Please can you confirm that this resolves locally?  Check /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt for the "Failed to decode IP address" log we saw before.  If this does resolve locally, please share /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt.

*         I notice that /etc/clearwater/shared_config's xdms_hostname variable is set to homer.pes, not homer.pes.com - that won't be the problem, but please can you fix it?

*         Memento isn't starting because Cassandra isn't running (or at least not running stably).

*         It looks as though Cassandra is cyclically restarting in the same way that we saw on the Homestead and Homer nodes.  Please can you check that your Sprout node has enough RAM too?  (If it does have enough RAM, it's possible that something else is causing it to restart - in this case, sharing /var/log/syslog and /var/log/monit.log would help.)

*         For some reason, etcd is not running.  Please can you share /var/log/clearwater-etcd/clearwater-etcd.log.*?



Thanks,



Matt

Sai,



Thanks for these diagnostics.



The key Sprout log (from /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt) is:



12-12-2015 17:35:44.664 UTC Error stack.cpp:222: Failed to decode IP address L-185000474 (gethostbyname() has returned error (PJ_ERESOLVE))

12-12-2015 17:35:44.665 UTC Error pjsip: Assert failed: stack.cpp:739 status == 0



Basically, this is saying that it's trying to resolve the "public_hostname" configuration option (which is set to "L-185000474").  As Ellie observed below, this looks odd (and the trace shows that it can't be resolved).  Please can you check and correct this configuration?  It must be resolvable by Sprout itself.



For Cassandra, the issue is that the OOM (out-of-memory) killer is killing the Cassandra process because it's taking up too much memory.  We can see this from /var/log/syslog:



Dec 11 23:13:21 sprout kernel: [   63.260285] clearwater-etcd invoked oom-killer: gfp_mask=0x200da, order=0, oom_score_adj=0

To run cleanly, Clearwater nodes need ~2 GB RAM (http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/stable/Manual_Install/ says "EC2 t2.small", which I will clarify).  The meminfo.txt file in the diagnostics bundle suggests that you're running on a VM with 0.5 GB RAM + 0.5 GB swap.  Please can you increase the RAM available to this VM?

Sai,



Thanks for your email.  Please can you share the diagnostics?



For Sprout, please can you gather /var/log/sprout/sprout_current.txt?



For Homer and Homestead, I suspect that Cassandra is the root cause.  Please can you gather the contents of /var/log/cassandra?



Also, you say that Cassandra is not coming up on Sprout.  Is that correct?  Unless you've also installed Memento (https://github.com/Metaswitch/memento), Sprout shouldn't be running Cassandra - please can you confirm?





Thanks,



Matt

Hi Matt,



Thanks for your response.



I have updated below changes to Ellis as well to all nodes.



Facing another issue in Sprout, Homer & homestead process. As sprout_process, Homer_process, Homestead_process as well as cassandra process for all three nodes are not coming UP.



Followed steps from http://clearwater.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Manual_Install/index.html



Configuration done same as Ellis and Bono.



Could you please guide me how to proceed further.



Thanks in advance!!



Regards,

Sai

Sai,



Thanks for your email.



Yes, you're correct that you shouldn't need to set up /etc/clearwater/config - it should automatically be created to be:



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/shared_config ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/shared_config

fi



. /etc/clearwater/local_config



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/user_settings ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/user_settings

fi



However, on your system, the /etc/clearwater/config file is instead an exact copy of /etc/clearwater/shared_config.



Is it possible that you accidentally copied /etc/clearwater/shared_config over /etc/clearwater/config at some point?  If not, maybe there's a bug in Clearwater in which shared_config can be copied over config (although I haven't seen this happen before)?



Please can you try fixing this by replacing your /etc/clearwater/config file with the content above?



Thanks,



Matt

Sai,



Thanks for sharing this.



I think the issue is that your /etc/clearwater/config file is a direct copy of your /etc/clearwater/shared_config file.  The /etc/clearwater/config file is automatically created as part of installing the clearwater-infrastructure package (which all Clearwater components depend on), and includes the /etc/clearwater/local_config and /etc/clearwater/shared_config files.



/etc/clearwater/config should read:



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/shared_config ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/shared_config

fi



. /etc/clearwater/local_config



if [ -f /etc/clearwater/user_settings ]

then

  . /etc/clearwater/user_settings

fi



Please can you correct it on the ellis node, and check that it's correct on all your other nodes too?



Thanks,



Matt

Sai,



Ellie is on vacation, so I've picked this up.



Well spotted on the clearwater-etcdctl issue - that could easily be the root cause of all the issues you're seeing.



clearwater-etcdctl only gives the "Could not determine local IP address" if it can't find local_ip in /etc/clearwater/local_config.  As Ellie observed below, it looks like you might have written your local configuration to /etc/clearwater/local_configuration rather than /etc/clearwater/local_config.



Please can you confirm that your configuration is written to /etc/clearwater/local_config and not /etc/clearwater/local_configuration?



Also, it looks as though you might not be subscribed to the mailing list (meaning that you might not see all responses to your question) - you can subscribe at http://lists.projectclearwater.org/mailman/listinfo/clearwater_lists.projectclearwater.org.



Thanks,



Matt

Hi Ellie,



Yes, I have added shared configuration file to Ellis.



In /etc/clearwater/local_config --> etcd_cluster given as IP's of all other nodes(bono,sprout, homer,homestead & ralf) including Ellis as well.



When i entered command cluster-health & etcdctl member list getting below error:



root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health

Could not determine local IP address

root at ellis:/etc/clearwater# sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list

Could not determine local IP address

root at ellis:/etc/clearwater#



Coming to public hostname given as system's  hostname.



After i was trying to send logs, ellis Logs are not generating in path (in /var/log/ellis), Even after keeping "To turn on debug logging for Ellis, write LOG_LEVEL

= logging.DEBUG to the local_settings.py file (at /usr/share/clearwater/ellis/local_settings.py)."



Could you please guide me, am i following correct process.



Thanks in advance!!



Regards,

Sai

Hi Sainath,



Have you added the shared configuration file to Ellis yet? Ellis needs this in order to run successfully (but not to install).



Also, how have you set up the etcd cluster on each node? Looking at the etcd_cluster below you don't have the Ellis node being part of the initial etcd cluster. On the initial install your etcd cluster value should be identical on each node (i.e. the etcd_cluster should contain the IP addresses of every initial node). What's the output of running "sudo clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health" and "sudo clearwater-etcdctl member list"?



In the details below you've put the config as being in "/etc/clearwater/local_configuration" - it needs to be in "/etc/clearwater/local_config.



Also, the public hostname looks like it's 'L-185000474', which doesn't look correct at all. Has this just been mangled by the mailing list?



Finally, if none of the above helps can you please send me the Ellis logs (in /var/log/ellis)?



Ellie
