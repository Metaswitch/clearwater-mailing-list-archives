Subject: [Project Clearwater] "No available numbers" error when trying to
 create new private identity in Ellis
Message-ID: <CAFQ97XF16nRyOW1TwKZzZte9Gjk-x-P=0Y8Ko+Ki-tdUHum+GA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I installed clearwater using docker-compose and clearwater-docker
repository. Installation was successful without any issues. I can login to
ellis via web browser. But when I tried to create private identity I got
following error:

{"status": 503, "message": "Service Unavailable", "reason": "No available
> numbers", "detail": {}, "error": true}


Would you please help me to resolve this issue?

Regards,
Ali

Subject: [Project Clearwater] Ubuntu 14.04 EOL, any updated builds?
Message-ID: <bd1ffc3b-78e6-1509-ecb1-c57a6fda831f@interoptechnologies.com>

Ubuntu 14.04 is now EOL.? Are there any plans for updated builds on 16 
or better yet 18?


Thanks,

Trey
